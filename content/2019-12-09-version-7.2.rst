Bug fixes

  permission (Svetlomir Balevski)
- ``testplans.views.ReorderCasesView`` now requires ``testplans.change_testplan``
  permission (Svetlomir Balevski)
- Fix counting bug in execution trends telemetry
- Fix several telemetry queries to still show data in the corner case
  where test cases have been deleted from a TestPlan but test runs
  are still available
- Fix broken bulk menu in TestRun page when (translated) status names
  are too long
- Automatically expand TestExecution comment history if there are comments
  present. Fixes
  `Issue #349 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/349>`_ (Matt Porter)

Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~

Important changes
-----------------

Soon Kiwi TCMS will switch from *OAuth* to *GitHub App* integration type with GitHub.
Login with your GitHub accounts will still be supported but you will also be
able to *INSTALL* Kiwi TCMS into your account/organization/repositories.
This will open the possibility for further integration with GitHub as expressed
in our `roadmap for 2019 <{filename}2019-01-10-2019-mission.markdown>`_!

We are going to share more information when this becomes available.



Upcoming conferences
--------------------

The next two events we are going to participate are:

* `DevConf.CZ, Jan 24-26, Brno <https://www.devconf.info/cz/>`_
  where Anton Sankov will be a speaker
* `FOSDEM, Feb 1-2, Brussels <{filename}2019-11-26-fosdem2020.markdown>`_
  where you can meet with the entire team


If you are around come and say "Happy testing"!


How to upgrade
---------------

`Backup <{filename}2018-07-30-docker-backup.markdown>`_ first!
If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then::

    cd path/containing/docker-compose/
    docker-compose down
    docker pull pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi
    docker pull centos/mariadb
    docker-compose up -d
    docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate

**WHERE:** ``docker-compose.yml`` has been updated from your private git repository!
The file provided in our GitHub repository is an example. Not for production use!

**WARNING:** ``pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:latest`` and ``docker-compose.yml`` will
always point to the latest available version! If you have to upgrade in steps,
e.g. between several intermediate releases, you have to modify the above workflow::

    # starting from an older Kiwi TCMS version
    docker-compose down
    docker pull pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:<next_upgrade_version>
    edit docker-compose.yml to use pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:<next_upgrade_version>
    docker-compose up -d
    docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
    # repeat until you have reached latest

Happy testing!
