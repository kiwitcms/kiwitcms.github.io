We are happy to announce that Kiwi TCMS is going to partner with the
[MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source)
open source program which is a 12 week internship alternative for
students interested in becoming software engineers.

[Major League Hacking (MLH)](https://mlh.io) is a mission-driven B-Corp focused
on empowering our next generation of technologists. Every year, more than
100,000 developers, designers, and makers join the MLH community to gain
hands-on experience and build their professional networks.
They are headquartered in the Greater New York Area, USA but operate world-wide.


Fellowship program
------------------

The Fall 2020 cohort runs between October 5 - December 21 and we're already
into the Contributing phase of the program.
Fellow students will be working on
[open issues](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues) from our backlog with
a focus on tasks from our
[open source bounty program](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/4)
but they can really work on any open task!

Once a pull request has been made it will undergo first round code review
by [*Cory Massaro*](https://github.com/flosincapite)
who is the dedicated MLH Python mentor. Once Cory gives the +1
each pull request will be reviewed by a member of the Kiwi TCMS core team like usual.

To minimize the risk of conflicts between contributors we are going to apply
the following rules:

- Each MLH fellow would add a comment on the issue they are
  interested in (applies to other contributors too);
- The issue will be assigned to them (new);
- The issue will be labeled with the
  [**MLH Fellowship**](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22MLH+Fellowship%22)
  label (new);
- The following comment will be added:
    *This issue/bounty has been assigned to an MLH fellow who is currently
    working on it. Pull requests towards the same issue from other contributors
    will not be considered at this time. Please pick something else to work on!*

Upon successful completion of tasks all MLH fellows will be eligible to claim their
bounties via [our Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms). This is
the same process other contributors go through, there is no difference.

Kiwi TCMS commits 2 core-team members who will serve office hours
on the [MLH Fellowship Discord](https://discord.gg/w7F55kn) server for
couple of hours per week in order to answer questions and keep the ball rolling.
We also commit to having bi-weekly meetings with MLH mentor(s) during the
duration of the program.

Kiwi TCMS would also like to thank our friend
[Eddie Jaoude](https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude) for putting us in touch with MLH
and helping bring this partnership to reality. Thank you Eddie!
