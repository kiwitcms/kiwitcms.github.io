**IMPORTANT:** this release introduces new database migrations!


*NOTE:* the API client has been initially developed as the *python-nitrate*
project by Petr Splichal and other contributors! We've decided to fork their
code base into Kiwi's repository and continue further development in a central
place. This makes it easier testing the API server and client together and
allows us to move more rapidly! 

As of now there isn't a lot of documentation
and examples on how to use the API client but we are looking to improve this.
Additional documentation and examples will be published in the project's
repository or on this blog!



How to upgrade
---------------

If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then

    cd Kiwi/
    docker-compose down
    make docker-image
    docker-compose up -d
    docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate

Happy testing!
