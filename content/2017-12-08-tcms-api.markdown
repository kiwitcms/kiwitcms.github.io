We are happy to announce the first official release of the
[tcms-api](https://pypi.org/project/tcms-api/) package!
This is a Python client for Kiwi TCMS.

There are couple of main distinctions in this module:

* mutable vs. immutable types of objects
* high-level class interface vs. low-level XML-RPC interface

For more information you should check-out the documentation
and the `script_examples/` directory.

At the moment the API client is both Python2 and Python3 compatible,
however it is tested only under Python3!

A bit of history
----------------

The original API client, like Kiwi TCMS itself began its origin under a
different name and was created primarily by Petr Splichal. Since then
Kiwi TCMS has evolved and we've decided that the API module needs to evolve
as well. At the moment the tcms-api module is a bit rough around the edges,
its documentation is not really the best one and it's currently advisable
to spend some time reading the code to figure out how everything works.

We're going to improve on all of these areas and we need help from the community
to do so! Please download the `tcms-api` module, check it out, write and contribute
example scripts (you can use the demo site for this), send us bug reports, suggestions
and pull requests!

Happy testing!
