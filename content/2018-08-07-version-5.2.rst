We're happy to announce Kiwi TCMS version 5.2! This release
introduces new database migrations and converts
the Docker image to a non-root user with uid 1001. You may have to adjust
ownership/permissions on the ``kiwi_uploads`` Docker volume!


The new ``pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:latest`` docker image has Image ID ``6bc4e3124fd4``.
`https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org <https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/>`_
has also been updated!


Changes since Kiwi TCMS 5.1
---------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgrade to `Django 2.1 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/releases/2.1/>`_
- Upgrade to ``django-report-builder 6.2.2``, compatible with Django 2.1
- Docker image now executes with uid 1001 instead of root

  - image based on ``centos7`` image instead of ``centos/httpd``
  - image now exposes ports 8080 and 8443
  - Apache logs now printed on Docker console
  - SSL certificates copied to ``/Kiwi/ssl`` inside Docker image instead of being bind-mounted
  - uploads dir changed to ``/Kiwi/uploads``
  - static dir changed to ``/Kiwi/static``
  - ``/Kiwi`` is now owned by uid 1001
  - ``/venv`` is now owned by uid 1001

- Fix pylint errors (Ivaylo Ivanov)
- Allow users to see other profiles via Admin
- Use password change form from Admin instead of custom one
- ``product.py`` will try to import ``local_settings.py`` if available in the

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Make password reset views public
- Don't crash when adding new users via Admin


Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove ``UserProfile`` model. Kiwi TCMS doesn't needs extra information
  about users so we remove this part of the application. Custom installations
  may choose to define their own profiles if they wish
- Remove custom ``DBModelBackend`` authentication backend
- Remove unused ``tcms.core.context_processors.auth_backend_processor``
- Remove unused ``get_using_backend()``. Fixes
  `Issue #261 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/261>`_
- Remove ``dj_pagination``. Fixes
  `Issue #110 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/110>`_


Settings
~~~~~~~~~

- ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` is removed
- ``PAGINATION_DEFAULT_PAGINATION`` is removed
- Navigation menu links are now defined in ``MENU_ITEMS`` and can be redefined


Signals
~~~~~~~

- ``USER_REGISTERED_SIGNAL`` now doesn't receive the ``backend`` parameter
