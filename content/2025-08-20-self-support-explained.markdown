Hello testers,
this page explains what the *Self Support* subscription is
and how it brings a bit more value beyond the Kiwi TCMS application itself.
You can read about the details below.



What is Self Support by Kiwi TCMS
---------------------------------

This is our lowest-tier of support services, where the majority of the work
falls onto the customer to host and run the Kiwi TCMS application.
It is an entry-level subscription which provides the basis for
all other subscriptions.


Who is this subscription for
----------------------------

*Self Support* is suitable for very small teams and individual engineers
where their Kiwi TCMS instance is not a mission critical piece of infrastructure -
perhaps an instance which is rarely used and isn't available 24/7, a development target
or an initial proof of concept installation.

These are typically organizations with less than 10 testers
which have no particular requirements other than being able to record and inspect
test execution results.


What do you get
---------------

This subscription entitles you to a few more items on top of the regular
*community edition* version of Kiwi TCMS. Please read for the details below.


What do all of the individual items mean
----------------------------------------

**Self-hosted on your server:** you will be responsible for installing, configuring
and managing your Kiwi TCMS instance. Backups, upgrades, etc. are entirely a
responsibility of your own.

NOTICE: We kindly ask you to adjust the quantity of items on the subscription in case you are running
multiple instances of Kiwi TCMS!


**Tagged releases and multi-arch builds:** regular *community edition* of Kiwi TCMS provides
only a `latest` version for the `x86_64` processor architecture.

As part of the *Self Support* subscription you get access to a private container repository
called [kiwitcms/version]({filename}pages/containers.markdown) with version tagged builds
for `aarch64` and `x86_64` CPU architectures. This gives you more hosting options and makes
it easier to upgrade to new versions when you decide to do so.



**Limited support:** *Self Support* customers do not receive technical support. Help from the
Kiwi TCMS team is limited to account and billing issues and response times are not guaranteed!


**Price freeze:** subscription price is usually updated once a year to account for inflation
and any additional services which may be provided under a particular subscription tier.
Customers with an active subscription are protected from these changes - price stays fixed
as long as your subscription is active! You will get full access to any new services as soon as
they are implemented.


**No ads:** regular *community edition* version of Kiwi TCMS comes with built-in advertisement
from [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/) rewards from which are paid out to
[opencollective.com/kiwitcms](https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/transactions) for transparency.

Container images from the *Self Support* subscription remove those ads and make the web
interface cleaner.


Happy Testing!
