We're happy to announce Kiwi TCMS version 4.1.3!
This is a bug-fix and enhancement update which upgrades to the latest Django
version, provides easier way for Docker administrators to override SSL certificates
and access httpd log files and resolves several issues. This release also includes
lots of internal code refactoring which removes code duplication and brings down
[CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi) metrics
to 26.9% of technical debt or 10 months to fix.

We've pushed the new `pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi` container image and updated the
demo instance at
[https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org](https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/).
Starting forward the demo will use
the `info-at-kiwitcms.org` email address for all communication sent. There are real
people behind this address so if you write to us we will reply!

- Only use `get_cases.html` template. Fixes

- Remove the `Export` button from TestPlan view, use Case->Export sub-menu
  item in the Cases tab. Also remove the export buttons from search and advanced
  search result templates. If you'd like to export the cases from a given
  plan you have to open it in a new browser window and use the menu
- Remove the `Print` button from plan search form
- Remove TestRun cloning from search results and plan details, use sub-menu
- Remove unnecessary JavaScript handling for `EnvGroup` edit view


### Settings

- Remove `PLAN_DELELE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE` setting (not used)


### Models and database migrations

- Use Django's own `DurationField`, instead of custom one. Fixes
  [Issue #183](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/183)

API clients must now send values for `estimated_time` which must be in a
format that `parse_duration()` understands, for example 'DD HH:MM:SS'! See
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/utils/#django.utils.dateparse.parse_duration>


**IMPORTANT:** this release introduces new database migrations!
