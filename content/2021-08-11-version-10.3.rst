Changes since Kiwi TCMS 10.2
----------------------------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update bleach from 3.3.0 to 4.0.0
- Update django from 3.2.5 to 3.2.6
- Update django-colorfield from 0.4.1 to 0.4.2
- Update django-tree-queries from 0.5.2 to 0.6.0

- Update python-gitlab from 2.9.0 to 2.10.0
- Update node_modules/html5sortable from 0.13.2 to 0.13.3
- Docker image is now based on Red Hat's Universal Base Image instead of
  CentOS 8. See https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image and
  https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/ubi-minimal/5c359a62bed8bd75a2c3fba8.

  **Important:**

      The ``mysql`` and ``psql`` binaries in the container image are not available anymore!
      Backup and restore instructions have been updated accordingly, see
      https://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/2018/07/30/how-to-backup-docker-volumes-for-kiwi-tcms/.

- Use ``initial_setup`` command to create public tenant in case we're running a multi-tenant
  instance. References
  `Enterprise #88 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/enterprise/issues/88>`_ (Ivajlo Karabojkov)
- Document that for Jira integration we use API tokens


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix a bug where drop-down selectors for test plans would not show any values when
  product is changed. Fixes
  `Issue #2467 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/2467>`_


Refactoring and testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add tests for missing coverage in ``kiwi_auth.admin``. References
  `Issue #1607 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1607>`_
  (Mariyan Garvanski)
- Fix some eslint issues and formatting in ``testcases/js/get.js``
- Use shorter URL when cloning test cases from TP page. References
  `Issue #1054 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1054>`_
- Limit URI size to 10KiB. This alone should allow for more than 1000 PKs
  specified for cloning. In addition Django itself limits the maximum number of
  GET/POST fields to 1000 via the ``DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS`` setting,
  see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#data-upload-max-number-fields.
