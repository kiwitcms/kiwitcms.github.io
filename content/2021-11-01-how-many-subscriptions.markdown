An active subscription provides you with certain guarantees that your organization
will continue to extract value from Kiwi TCMS and is your buy-in into the
open source world.
*We recommend that customers purchase a subscription for every container running
Kiwi TCMS* however this becomes distorted for teams who don't actively seek support
and large organizations! Here are our guidelines.


Phase of deployment
-------------------

**Casual exploration:** No subscription required. Use <https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org>
to explore Kiwi TCMS and formulate your questions and further plan of action.

**Serious evaluation** or **Proof of concept:** 1x Private Tenant SaaS or 1x Enterprise.
You will have lots of questions during this period and you will need answers in
a timely manner. You can cancel at any time!

**Pilot:** 2-3x Private Tenant SaaS or 1x Enterprise during the pilot period.
Consider add-on services if you need data migration or custom development
for a successful pilot. Plan your future needs and issues you'd like to see fixed.

**Production:** make your decision according to the size of your test team and
anticipated support needs, see below.


> Our mission is to transform the testing process inside your organization.
> You don't have to do it alone! Let us help you!


Number of testers
-----------------

**<= 25:** 1x Private Tenant SaaS

**25-100:** 2-5x Private Tenant SaaS; consider splitting teams
and purchase a subscription for each of them

**100 - 200:** 1x Enterprise; consider additional subscriptions of any kind for
non-production instances

**200 - 500** - 2-3x Enterprise; consider additional subscriptions of any kind
for non-production instances

**500 - 1000:** - 5x Enterprise; consider additional Enterprise subscriptions for
non-production instances

**Over 1000:** 10x Enterprise; consider add-on services for custom development


> Note that these are not hard rules as we don't restrict the number of accounts
> registered into a specific instance nor how many containers you deploy!


--
> Note that you can still deploy Kiwi TCMS with a 1x subscription inside organization
> with thousands of testers. Or even no subscription at all. Do you really value your
> testing infrastructure that low though?
