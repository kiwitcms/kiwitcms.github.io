Several months ago we've announced
[the collection of anonymous analytics]({filename}2024-02-23-anonymous-analytics.markdown)
from Kiwi TCMS with the analytics dashboard for this website being immediately
accessible via <https://plausible.io/kiwitcms.org>.

Today we're happy to share that the anonymous analytics dashboard for the
`kiwitcms/kiwi` container image is fully accessible via <https://plausible.io/kiwitcms-container>.

As evident there is no personally identifiable information that is being collected!

Happy Testing!
