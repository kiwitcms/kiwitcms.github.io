Dear testers, we are happy to share that Kiwi TCMS has been distinguished
with the *Excellence in Innovation 2020* award by
[Applied Research and Communications Fund](http://www.arcfund.net/) in Bulgaria.
This is also the first award that we receive locally and we're very happy
about that!

Kiwi TCMS was a finalist in the *Digital transformation* category for the fact
that leveraging the power of open source we've transformed an abandoned project
(the predecessor of Kiwi TCMS) into a usable product with over 270000 downloads
to date!

If you would like to checkout the awards ceremony and all of the particiants
go to [www.innovation.bg](https://www.innovation.bg/), we're listed under
*Отворени Технологии България ЕООД*
(the name of our [parent company]({filename}pages/legal.markdown))!
Text and video is not in English however!


Happy Testing!
