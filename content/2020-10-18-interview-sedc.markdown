Hello testers,
recently we had a chat with
[Gjore Zaharchev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gjorezaharchev/),
a QA manager at Seavus and Testing Coach at
SEDC Software Testing Academy in Skopje. Here is their story
and how they use Kiwi TCMS!

[Seavus Educational and Development Center](https://www.sedc.mk/)
is a private company as part of the Seavus Group and a specialized
training center for education of staff in the fields of programming,
design, computer networks and software testing.
Around 90 students pass through their software testing academy every year
with 60 students enrolled thus far. The training program is 6 months
and covers many basic IT skills, manual testing, ISTQB fundamentals and
automation testing. SEDC is located in Skopje, North Macedonia.

Hands-On Lab Activities
-----------------------

The study program includes multiple individual and team projects, intermediate
exams and a final project. These are intended to exercise the most commonly used
test design techniques and practice writing up the test scenarios. All
scenarios are written directly in Kiwi TCMS. We've even seen test plans and
test cases created during Christmas and the New Year holidays last year!


The software under test is usually the programs developed by students
from our *Academy for Programming*, says Gjore.
Later in the program we use real websites in order to show some bugs in the
wild, he continues. On occasion students have found interesting problems with the websites of
*Booking.com* and *WizzAir*. They've also managed to find a critical issue on
one of our local systems. These are the trials and tribulations of
teaching & testing in the wild.

> and shutdown the victimized website right in the middle of the session. ;-)



Why did you decide to use Kiwi TCMS
-----------------------------------

When searching for a TCMS platform for the academy one of the decisive
factors was cost. By being open source Kiwi TCMS has the side benefit of
having zero initial usage cost which was very important for us.
Regardless of that Kiwi TCMS is very easy to install & setup using Docker,
very easy to on-board new users and generally well received by everyone.

> This is a huge benefit for students because they can experiment with Kiwi TCMS
> and immediately see how some items work when executing testing workflows.
> For example they can visualize how a regression test run looks like compared
> to a test run for a critical security fix; or they can simulate working in
> groups to cover execution of a larger test plan.


What do your students say
-------------------------

Overall they like the workflow and can easily navigate within the user interface.
They feel very positive because there is no complexity in the system and
it is very intuitive. One of the areas which often receives questions is
the ability to record test automation results!

*Answer: Kiwi TCMS has the ability to fetch names and test results directly, via
plugins for several
[test automation frameworks](https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html)
while others are on our backlog -
[TestNG](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/692),
[Jenkins](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1072),
[C#/NUnit](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/2020)!
Anyone interested is welcome to ***Subscribe*** to each GitHub issue and follow the progress.
Some issues are also part of our
[open source bounty program]({tag}bounty-program) so we urge students to
take a look and contribute!*


Anything you want to ask our team
---------------------------------

At SEDC we'd like to know what are your plans for Kiwi TCMS in the future?

*Answer: Our plans, like our software, are transparent, check-out posts
[tagged roadmap]({tag}roadmap)! For 2020 this is refactoring of the
last remaining legacy bits, continue work on our Telemetry feature and
more work towards integration with various bug trackers and test automation
frameworks. An extension to that is tighter integration with the GitHub
platform!*
