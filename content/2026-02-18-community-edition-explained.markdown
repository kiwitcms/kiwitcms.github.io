This page explains what Kiwi TCMS *Community Edition* is,
how it ships and what risks are associated with it.
Please read about the details below.


What is Kiwi TCMS Community Edition
-----------------------------------

This is the official version of the Kiwi TCMS application as produced by
our own team with the help of many contributors. It may also be
referred to *upstream* or *the community edition* version and comes
packaged as a container image which is publicly available and can be downloaded via the
`docker pull pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi` command!


Who is this for
---------------

*Community Edition* is suitable for developers, teams and organizations which
are happy to run Kiwi TCMS without any warranty and safeguards for development,
testing and even production purposes!


What do you get
---------------

You get access the publicly available container image; public documentation
and source code but not much else!


What do all of the individual items mean
----------------------------------------

**Upstream container image:** Kiwi TCMS is packaged as a single
[container image]({filename}pages/containers.markdown). See
[Running Kiwi TCMS as a container](https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing_docker.html)
to get started!


**Only x86_64 build:** the *community edition* container is built on Linux,
suitable for Intel/AMD 64bit processors only.


**No version tags:** the *community edition* container is always the `latest` version!
There are no other versions available!


**GPL-2.0 license:** Kiwi TCMS is an open source software, with very long history,
with its primary core licensed under the GNU GPL-2.0 license!


**No warranty:** the *community edition* version of Kiwi TCMS
is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
[GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)
for more details.


**EthicalAds:** the *community edition* version of Kiwi TCMS comes with built-in
advertisement from [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/) rewards from which are
paid out to [opencollective.com/kiwitcms](https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/transactions)
for transparency.


**You assume all risk:** you must understand and accept that open source comes with associated risks.
To name just a few: our team disappears and stops development;
security issues stay unresolved; code slowly becomes outdated & may incur technical debt in the case
of one-off patches! All of these have
[happened in the past](/blog/tags/roadmap/) with the predecessor of what is now Kiwi TCMS.


There is **no charge** but please understand that software isn't *zero cost*!
You pay for it indirectly with time and effort invested in engineering, operations,
maintenance and resolving any issues which may arise from the use of said software,
regardless of whether it is open source or not!


IMPORTANT: open source and Kiwi TCMS by extension, provide you with more options
when it comes to mitigating risks and cost compared to proprietary software.
However the easiest way to secure the future of Kiwi TCMS is to
[become a customer](/#subscriptions) and help us sustain development!


Happy Testing!
