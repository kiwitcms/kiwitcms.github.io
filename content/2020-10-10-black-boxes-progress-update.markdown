Hello testers, as you know our
[friends at Pionir]({filename}2020-05-26-partnership-with-pionir.markdown)
are working on physical hardware which can be used for interactive training and
explanation of the Black-box testing technique. The inspiration
comes from [James Lyndsayâ€™s Black Box Puzzles](http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/) and
[Claudiu Draghia](http://blog.brainforit.com/2017/02/06/black-boxes-for-black-box-testing/).


We have the source code of 3 boxes already published at
<https://github.com/kiwitcms/black-boxes> but still missing bill of materials,
design files for 3D printing and some basic instructions how to put everything
together. There was a delay in delivery of some components but most of the work
is close to completion. You may subscribe to
[issues for each box](https://github.com/kiwitcms/black-boxes/issues) to follow
the progress! Here are some images & videos from the development process.

According to Pionir's own words:
*We are testing the salience box and trying to cause emotional effect of an element.
Vuk made a mistake and now he can't turn it off :D. How's that for dogfooding?*
