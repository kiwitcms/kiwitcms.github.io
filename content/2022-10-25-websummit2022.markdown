Kiwi TCMS is happy to announce that we're taking part in
[WebSummit 2022](https://websummit.com/), Nov 01-04 in Lisbon, Portugal.
We're joining as a [featured startup](https://websummit.com/startups/featured-startups)
in the *Enterprise Software Solutions* category.

Kiwi TCMS will have an on-site presence on
**Wednesday, Nov 02 at Pavilion 4, Stand A709**. Check-out the map for more details:

For engineers
-------------

At the exhibition stand you will have the opportunity to perform some real
[black-box testing]({filename}2020-10-10-black-boxes-progress-update.markdown),
learn about Salience bias, Peltzman effect and Wason's experiments and take a photo with
our lovely mascot. We've got new stickers too!

Alex and Zaklina will be there to answer all of your questions regarding
open source, community, support, various integrations and the differences between
*Self-Support*, *SaaS* and *Enterprise* [subscriptions](/#subscriptions)!

**IMPORTANT:** We've previously announced participation in
[Testing Portigal](https://testingportugal.pstqb.pt/en/) at the end of November.
Unfortunately this had to be canceled due to personal reasons. If you are a test or
QA engineer please swing by and Alex can tell you a bit about his presentation!


For partners
------------

If you are another ISV providing engineering tools, a product outsourcing company
or a devel/testing services venture we've got a partnership proposal for you!

We're interested in partners where we can integrate other products with Kiwi TCMS
and provide a better offering; provide extra services (e.g. managed hosting) and/or
provide more transparency to your own customers (e.g. allow them to see how their products
are being tested).

Message us via the WebSummit mobile app and request a meeting or better yet,
find our team on-site!
