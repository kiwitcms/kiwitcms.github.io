We are happy to announce that Kiwi TCMS is going to partner with
[Vola Software](https://volasoftware.com/) to provide 2 interns with
opportunities for hacking open source and bootstrapping their careers!

Vola Software is a custom software development company
in one of the poorest regions of the European Union and a long-time contributor
to their local ecosystem via
[Vratsa Software Community](https://school.vratsasoftware.com/).
They are located in Vratsa, Bulgaria.


Internship program
------------------

[Alexander Tsvetanov](https://github.com/Allexander203) and
[Vladislav Ankov](https://github.com/vladi1337) are joining the Kiwi TCMS team
for a 10 month adventure until the end of July 2021 with the opportunity
to continue for another year afterwards!

Both Sasho and Vladi are students in the Professional Technical Gymnasium
in Vratsa and are required to work part-time as junior software developers during the
last 2 years of their education. Given that they have very limited practical
experience and the additional red tape around hiring youngsters many software
companies directly avoid such kind of relationship. This creates a catch-22
circle for both employers who are looking to hire somewhat experienced young people
and youngsters who are looking to advance their practical skills.

Here's where Kiwi TCMS steps-in! What better way to improve practical knowledge
than contributing to an actively used and actively maintained open source software!
We are nearing the 200K downloads mark on Docker Hub so changes made by
Sasho and Vladi will be visible to a very big pool of our users and customers!

Both have already started their open source adventure last week and are currently
going through some training. However they were faced with real problems which
resulted in
[bug discovery](https://github.com/python-bugzilla/python-bugzilla/issues/134)
and a
[pull request](https://github.com/python-bugzilla/python-bugzilla/pull/135) for
**python-bugzilla** underlined by a
[20 years old issue in Python](https://bugs.python.org/issue41965).
How's that for a start ?


Administrative
--------------

Vola Software is the direct employer for Sasho and Vladi because they have the
necessary permits and experience required for hiring youngsters. Kiwi TCMS is
the direct technical mentor and will be acting as a customer to Vola Software!

Vola Software will be paying a minimal salary to our interns as required by law.
Kiwi TCMS will reimburse the full amount while Vola Software
will be covering their accounting and administrative expenses.
Both Sasho and Vladi will also be eligible for our
[open source bounty-program](/blog/tags/bounty-program/) as an extra stimulation!

All expenses will be fully transparent and visible via
[our Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/expenses/)!
