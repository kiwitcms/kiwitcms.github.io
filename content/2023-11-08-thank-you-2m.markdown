We are happy to share that Kiwi TCMS has surpassed 2 million downloads on Docker Hub.
At the time of writing this blog post the exact number is *2004544*!
We say a big THANK YOU you to our entire community!

As luck would have it we were able to announce this achievement at the annual
[OpenFest](https://www.openfest.org) conference in Bulgaria and celebrate the day with
not one, but two kiwi bird mascots.

Thank you and Happy testing!
