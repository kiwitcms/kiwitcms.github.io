Hello testers,
we are conducting a little research/survey into how other testers and QA professionals
use modern platforms like GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. At this moment in time our goal
is to collect as much information as possible in order to understand the existing ecosystem.

If you can spare 5 minutes of your time please check-out
[https://forms.gle/avqjWVvSPsE4SWQr5](https://forms.gle/avqjWVvSPsE4SWQr5).

We promise there will be no follow up emails unless you indicate that you agree to that.

Happy Testing!
