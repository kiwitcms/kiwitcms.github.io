Kiwi TCMS is happy to announce that we're taking part in
[Collision 2022](https://collisionconf.com/), Jun 20-23 in Toronto, Canada.
We're joining as a [featured startup](https://collisionconf.com/startups/featured-startups)
in the *Enterprise Software Solutions* category.

Kiwi TCMS will have an on-site presence on
**Thursday, Jun 23, Stand A3201**. Check-out the map for more details:

For engineers
-------------

At the exhibition stand you will have the opportunity to perform some real
[black-box testing]({filename}2020-10-10-black-boxes-progress-update.markdown),
learn about Salience bias, Peltzman effect and Wason's experiments and take a photo with
our lovely mascot.

The Kiwi TCMS team will be there to answer all of your questions regarding
open source, community, support, various integrations and the differences between
*Self-Support*, *SaaS* and *Enterprise* [subscriptions](/#subscriptions)!

If you are a test or QA engineer please answer our survey
<https://forms.gle/LTYnimNjbUaSmTeL8>. Participants may claim a small surprise at our booth!


For startups
------------

We know that in a startup, the major strength of the people is that they are multitaskers.
And it is often the case that the founders will perform some functional and acceptance testing
because they know all the important use-cases.

Still you need to document and organize your testing activities early on. You need to
start collecting information about which features of the product have been tested and
how they have been tested. That's the basis on which you can scale your QA team and
future testing activities.

If you are a fellow startup exhibitor please swing by out stand to talk about
organizing your product testing with Kiwi TCMS. We know the drill because we're in
the same boat!


For partners
------------

If you are another ISV providing engineering tools, a product outsourcing company
or a devel/testing service venture we've got a partnership proposal for you!

We're interested in partners where we can integrate other products with Kiwi TCMS
and provide a better offering; provide extra services (e.g. managed hosting) and/or
provide more transparency to your own customers (e.g. allow them to see how their products
are being tested).

Message us via the [Collision app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collision)
and request a meeting or better yet, find our team on-site!
