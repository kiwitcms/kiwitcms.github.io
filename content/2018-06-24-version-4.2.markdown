We're happy to announce Kiwi TCMS and tcms-api version 4.2!
This is a security, bug-fix and enhancement update which upgrades to the latest
Django version under Python 3.6.
We've pushed new `pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi` container image and updated the
demo instance at [https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org](https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/)!

This version also includes GDPR related changes which affect our project. Read below
for the details.

### Models and database migrations

- Increase checksum fields size to hold the new checksum values
- Increase `activation_key` field size to 64 chars

### GDPR related

- Allow users to delete their accounts. Link is present on `My profile` page.
  This will also delete any related objects using cascade delete
- Try not to be so obvious when it comes to displaying email addresses across
  the web interface. Instead show username and link to profile

In addition the following changes were deployed to our infrastructure:

- On our website the `Subscribe to our newsletter` is now a link, instead of
  embedded form because embedded forms can't display GDPR compliance fields.
  If you wish to receive email from Kiwi TCMS you need to select the `Email`
  checkbox when signing up for the newsletter.
- Double opt-in is now enabled when subscribing to our newsletter
- All newsletter addresses that have been unsubscribed have been deleted
- Upon registration for [https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org](https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/)
  you are no longer subscribed
  to the newsletter. Now we send a welcome email with a link to the newsletter
  so you can subscribe if you want
- [https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org](https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/)
  now runs a cron job which deletes inactive accounts
  and all of their related data. The cron job runs weekly


We're trying to be respectful to your private data and not expose that to any
3rd parties or use it for means other than making Kiwi TCMS better open source
software. If you spot areas for improvement please
[report an issue](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/new) so we can take
a look at it!
