Changes since Kiwi TCMS 6.5.3
-----------------------------


Security
~~~~~~~~

- Explicitly require marked v0.6.1 to fix medium severity ReDoS vulnerability. See
  `SNYK-JS-MARKED-73637 <https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MARKED-73637>`_


Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update ``python-gitlab`` from 1.7.0 to 1.8.0
- Update ``django-contrib-comments`` from 1.9.0 to 1.9.1
- More strings marked as translatable (Christophe CHAUVET)
- When creating new TestCase you can now change notification settings.
  Previously this was only possible during editing
- Document import-export approaches. Closes
  `Issue #795 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/795>`_
- Document available test automation plugins
- Improve documentation around Docker customization and SSL termination
- Add documentation example of reverse rroxy configuration for HAProxy (Nicolas Auvray)
- ``TestPlan.add_case()`` will now set the sortkey to highest in plan + 10 (Rik)
- Add ``LinkOnly`` issue tracker. Fixes
  `Issue #289 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/289>`_
- Use the same HTML template for both TestCase new & edit
- New API methods for adding, removing and listing attachments. Fixes
  `Issue #446 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/446>`_:

  - TestPlan.add_attachment()
  - TestCase.add_attachment()
  - TestPlan.list_attachments()
  - TestCase.list_attachments()
  - Attachments.remove_attachment()


Database migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Populate missing ``TestCase.text`` history.
  In version 6.5 the ``TestCase`` model was updated to store the text
  into a single field called ``text`` instead of 4 separate fields.
  During that migration historical records were updated to have
  the new ``text`` field but values were not properly assigned.

  The "effect" of this is that in TestCaseRun records you were not
  able to see the actual text b/c it was None.

  This change ammends ``0006_merge_text_field_into_testcase_model`` for
  installations which have not yet migrated to 6.5 or later. We also
  provide the data-only migration ``0009_populate_missing_text_history``
  which will inspect the current state of the DB and copy the text to
  the last historical record.


Removed functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove legacy reports. Closes
  `Issue #657 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/657>`_
- Remove "Save & Continue" functionality from TestCase edit page
- Renamed API methods:

  - ``TestCaseRun.add_log()``    -> ``TestCaseRun.add_link()``
  - ``TestCaseRun.remove_log()`` -> ``TestCaseRun.remove_link()``
  - ``TestCaseRun.get_logs()``   -> ``TestCaseRun.get_links()``

  These methods work with URL links, which can be added or removed to
  test case runs.

How to upgrade
---------------

If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then::

    cd Kiwi/
    git pull
    docker-compose down
    docker pull pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi
    docker pull centos/mariadb
    docker-compose up -d
    docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate

Don't forget to `backup <{filename}2018-07-30-docker-backup.markdown>`_
before upgrade!

**WARNING:** ``pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:latest`` and ``docker-compose.yml`` will
always point to the latest available version! If you have to upgrade in steps,
e.g. between several intermediate releases, you have to modify the above workflow::

    # starting from an older Kiwi TCMS version
    docker-compose down
    docker pull pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:<next_upgrade_version>
    edit docker-compose.yml to use pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:<next_upgrade_version>
    docker-compose up -d
    docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
    # repeat until you have reached latest

Happy testing!
