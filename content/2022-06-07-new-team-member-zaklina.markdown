Kiwi TCMS is pleased to welcome Zaklina Stojnev to [our team]({filename}pages/team.html)!

<img class="rounded" src="/images/team/zstojnev.jpg">

She holds an engineering degree in computer science and
has been working as a test engineer for more than 10 years.
In the last couple of years her main focus is automation in testing,
finding ways to improve testing process and tools that will support testing activities.

Zaklina will be the primary contact for our
[History of Testing](https://github.com/kiwitcms/history-of-testing) project where we are
compiling a database of people who influenced or made important contributions to our professional field.

With her prior experience as a conference organizer Zaklina will also be lending a much needed hand
in preparing the *Testing and Automation* devroom at *FOSDEM* and showcasing Kiwi TCMS at different
events.

You can find her on-boarding progress at [TR-1190](https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/1190/) and her
contributions on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+author%3Azaklinica+archived%3Afalse+user%3Akiwitcms).

Happy Testing!
