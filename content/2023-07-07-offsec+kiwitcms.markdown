[OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/) is an American international company working
in information security, penetration testing and digital forensics. Operating
from around 2007, the company has created multiple open source projects,
advanced security courses, the ExploitDB vulnerability database, and the popular Kali Linux.
It has recently released the Kali Purple platform, a dedicated platform for
cyber defence analysts and a platform for security services.

[Introduction to Assurance Testing](https://portal.offsec.com/library/all/new-releases/modal/module/introduction-to-assurance-testing/)
is a brand new training course covering the defensive testing techniques used
to establish a level of assurance that your server is secure. It is the first
course of OffSec‚Äôs OSDA cyber defence learning path. This course introduces the
context for security testing and explains how security testing aligns to the business.

*Chapter 3: Creating and Using Security Test Documentation explains the documentation
used in security related testing and introduces Kiwi TCMS as the test management tool of choice!*

The course is part of Offsec‚Äôs fundamentals package which is designed as baseline knowledge
and skills for all security professionals and in particular for those who wish to progress
to the OffSec Defence Analyst (OSDA) certification.  The Assurance Testing course,
and the Kiwi TCMS tool which it uses, gives developers and security testers alike a good
understanding of the best practice approach to test case management and helps build their
skills in carrying out testing in a disciplined way. Using Kiwi TCMS provides the
opportunity to improve the processes and documentation around security testing,
and around the wider functional testing as well.

Kiwi TCMS bridges the gap between security requirements and software development by
enabling standardized test cases to be developed by the security team whilst
software developers and dedicated QA teams can use these same test cases to ensure that
security requirements are met. With preset test plans and test cases,
execution of security tests can proceed in the same way as for any other non-functional testing,
and any issues identified during testing can be fixed and tests can be executed again.

Learning how to use Kiwi TCMS as part of the Introduction to Assurance Testing course helps
both security teams and QA teams work together in a common environment to improve
the quality and security of their software. Using Kiwi TCMS enables security teams to
provide clear instructions to QA teams as to how to use specialist security testing tools.
For example, having clear test cases for running the PowerShell audit tool
for the Active Directory Certificate Server, PSPKIAudit, means that the test team can take advantage
of a powerful testing tool without needing the specialist knowledge that might otherwise be required
to use and interpret the results of such a tool.
