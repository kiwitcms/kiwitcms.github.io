Changes since Kiwi TCMS 6.7
---------------------------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update Django from 2.2 to 2.2.1
- Update django-simple-history from 2.7.0 to 2.7.2
- Update django-grappelli from 2.12.2 to 2.12.3
- Update psycopg2 from 2.8 to 2.8.2
- Update pygithub from 1.43.6 to 1.43.7
- Upgrade pip and setuptools inside Docker image
- Update documentation with newer screenshots and updated Tutotial. Fixes
  `Issue #837 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/837/>`_ (@Prome88)
- Document how to enable public read-only views
- Remove deprecated documentation section about Bugzilla authentication
- Install PostgreSQL libraries in Docker image which makes it easier to
  switch the DB backend without rebuilding the entire image
- Remove npm, libxml2-devel and libxslt-devel from Docker image
- Database engine configuration now respects the ``KIWI_DB_ENGINE`` environment
  variable which defaults to ``django.db.backends.mysql``. This will make it
  easier for admins to change DB engine by updating their ``docker-compose.yml``


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Pin bootstrap-switch to version 3.3.4 in ``package.json``. Fixes
  `Issue #916 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/916/>`_


Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated `French translation <https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms/fr#>`_
- Updated `Slovenian translation <https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms/sl#>`_
- New language `Russian <https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms/ru#>`_
- New language `Czech <https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms/cz#>`_


Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Don't use ``Site.objects.get_current()`` because it has an internal cache
  and causes email notifications from tenants to use the wrong URL
- More changes around renaming of TestCaseRun to TestExecution


GitHub Marketplace
------------------

During the past week we have silently launched Kiwi TCMS on
`GitHub Marketplace <https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms/>`_. Free plans
will be redirected to
`public.tenant.kiwitcms.org <https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/>`_
while paid plans will be hosted under ``*.tenant.kiwitcms.org`` sub-domains!

Our team is still working on all requirements for GitHub integration and we will
issue a formal statement when ready!


How to upgrade
---------------

If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then::

    cd Kiwi/
    git pull
    docker-compose down
    docker pull pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi
    docker pull centos/mariadb
    docker-compose up -d
    docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate

Don't forget to `backup <{filename}2018-07-30-docker-backup.markdown>`_
before upgrade!

**WARNING:** ``pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:latest`` and ``docker-compose.yml`` will
always point to the latest available version! If you have to upgrade in steps,
e.g. between several intermediate releases, you have to modify the above workflow::

    # starting from an older Kiwi TCMS version
    docker-compose down
    docker pull pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:<next_upgrade_version>
    edit docker-compose.yml to use pub.kiwitcms.eu/kiwitcms/kiwi:<next_upgrade_version>
    docker-compose up -d
    docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
    # repeat until you have reached latest

Happy testing!
