Hello testers,
starting today we are discontinuing the ability to register user
accounts on <https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org>! New accounts can still
be created by logging in via the existing OAuth integrations - GitHub, GitLab and Google!

How does this affect users
--------------------------

* New account registrations via email+password are not possible anymore - use OAuth login
* Existing users are able to login via OAuth and/or email+password - reset your password
  if forgotten
* New subscription purchases will create user accounts automatically -
  reset your password before first login.
  *Note: existing subscribers already have accounts*
* Inviting new users to a Private Tenant, `PLUGINS -> Tenant -> Invite users`
  will create user accounts automatically - reset your password before first login


Happy Testing!
