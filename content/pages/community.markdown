# Acknowledgements

Kiwi TCMS was initially started by [Red Hat, Inc.](https://www.redhat.com/en) under the name Nitrate.
It was intended as a replacement for Mozilla's Testopia and has grown on its own
[since then](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#381804-jan-24-2017-released-on-mrsenkocom).
Latest development is done by
[the Kiwi TCMS team]({filename}team.html) with sponsorship from
[Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms) and
[Mr. Senko](http://mrsenko.com/).

The Kiwi TCMS logo is based on the [Kiwix icon](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kiwix_icon.svg) by Kelson.
