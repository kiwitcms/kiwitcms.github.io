Privacy policy
==============

For the purposes of login and/or passwordless login via GitHub, GitLab, Google, etc,
Kiwi TCMS is requesting the following data: **your name**, **email address**. This information
is stored in our database and is linked to your Kiwi TCMS account which lets you
login into the Kiwi TCMS application. User account information is accessible only
to the administrators of Kiwi TCMS and is not publicly exposed to 3rd parties.

Data, other than user accounts, stored on the so called *Public Tenant*,
aka *public.tenant.kiwitcms.org*,
is visible to all application users and is intended for demonstrational purposes.
Everyone has the same read/write/delete access to everything except other users' profiles!
There are no guarantees or SLA for *Public Tenant*.

*Public Tenant* accounts and all of their data are removed after 30 days of
inactivity. This applies to users who have not logged in during that period
and users who never confirmed their accounts!

*Private Tenant* and all of their data are removed within 45 days after
their subscription expiration.

Your user profile information is not shared with 3rd parties!


Anonymous analytics
===================

Kiwi TCMS uses Plausible Analytics and Scarf on this website, inside our
[official container images]({filename}containers.markdown) and
all tenants provisioned under `https://*.tenant.kiwitcms.org` to collect some
anonymous usage data for statistical purposes.

Our goal is to track overall trends and usage patterns in Kiwi TCMS application(s),
not to track individuals.
All data is in aggregate only and no personally identifiable information is collected.
Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices
(device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit.
