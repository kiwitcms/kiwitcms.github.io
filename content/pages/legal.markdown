Public Tenant data is shared between all public accounts and is intended for

Anonymous analytics
===================

Kiwi TCMS uses Plausible Analytics on this website, inside our
[official container images]({filename}containers.markdown) and
all tenants provisioned under `https://*.tenant.kiwitcms.org` to collect some
anonymous usage data for statistical purposes.

Our goal is to track overall trends
and usage patterns in Kiwi TCMS application(s), not to track individual visitors.
All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is sent to Plausible.
Data collected includes referral sources,
top pages, visit duration, information from the devices
(device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit.
Read more in the Plausible Analytics [Data Policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy)
and [our blog]({filename}../2024-02-23-anonymous-analytics.markdown).
