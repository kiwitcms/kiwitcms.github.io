Settings
~~~~~~~~

- Change ``TEMP_DIR`` to ``/var/tmp`` which affects the location in which
  intermediate files coming from migrations are saved. If ``/var/tmp`` doesn't
  exist the fallback is ``/tmp`` which on modern Linux distributions is ephemeral
- Add ``DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`` to hard-code expected behavior and prevent unwanted
  changes introduced by future versions of Django


Database
~~~~~~~~

- Add new fields to ``TestCase`` - ``setup_duration``, ``testing_duration`` and
  a calculatable ``expected_duration`` attribute (Angelina)
- Remove unused ``TestRun.product_version`` field


API
~~~

- Method ``TestRun.filter()`` return value changes field names:

  - ``product_version`` -> ``plan__product_version``
  - ``product_version__value`` -> ``plan__product_version__value``
  
  .. warning::
  
      You will need to adjust your API scripts if using these fields!

- Method ``Component.filter()`` will return only distinct results
- New method ``KiwiTCMS.version()``

~~~~~~~~~

- Remove links and icons from TestRun print styling. Fixes
  `Issue #2263 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/2263>`_ and
  `Issue #2264 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/2264>`_ (Gagan Deep)
- Emails notifications are now sent into server language. Fixes
  `Issue #1589 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1589>`_ (Kapil Bansal)
- Fix compatibility bug for "advanced search & add" popup windows and latest Chrome
  browsers. Fixes `Issue #2100 <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/2100>`_
- Redirect TestPlan Admin "Add" to the correct URL
- Fix wrong TestExecution field names in queryset & HTML template. Refs
