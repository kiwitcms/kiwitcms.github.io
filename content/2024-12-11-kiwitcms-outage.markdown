Hello testers,
in the spirit of transparency we'd like to inform everyone that
on Dec 11th 2024 between 07:20-09:30 UTC Kiwi TCMS suffered a major outage!

The Kiwi TCMS web application was up and running, however the database behind
it had stopped accepting requests resulting in 500 Internal Server Error page visible
to everyone. A little over 1000 requests (both manual and via API) were affected!

As of this time service has been restored and our team is taking corrective actions.
So far it doesn't look like that there was loss of historical data.
