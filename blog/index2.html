<p>Attention testers! On behalf of the
<a href="https://fosdem-testingautomation.github.io/"><em>Testing and Continuous Delivery devroom</em></a>
we'd like to announce that call for participation is now open.
This room is about building better software through a focus on testing and
continuous delivery practices across all layers of the stack.
The purpose of this devroom is to share good and bad examples around the question
“how to improve quality of our software by automating tests, deliveries or deployments”
and to showcase new open source tools and practices.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> for FOSDEM 2025 this devroom is a merger between the former
<em>Testing and Automation</em> and <em>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</em> devrooms and
is jointly organized between devroom managers in previous FOSDEM editions!
Kiwi TCMS is proud to be part of the team hosting this devroom!</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> devroom will take place on Saturday, February 1st 2025 at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/transportation/">ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium</a>!
Presentations will be streamed online but all accepted speakers are required to deliver
their talks in person!</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for topics that are a good fit for this devroom:</p>
<p>Testing in the real, open source world</p>
<ul>
<li>War stories/strategies for testing large scale or complex projects</li>
<li>Tools that extend the ability to test low-level code, e.g. bootloaders, init systems, etc.</li>
<li>Projects that are introducing new/interesting ways of testing "systems"</li>
<li>Address the automated testing frameworks fragmentation</li>
<li>Stories from end-users (e.g. success/failure)</li>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Continuous Deployment</li>
<li>Security in Software Supply Chain</li>
<li>Pipeline standardization</li>
<li>Interoperability in CI/CD</li>
<li>Lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)</p>
<ul>
<li>Project showcases, modern tooling</li>
<li>How your open source tool made developing quality software better</li>
<li>What tools do you use to setup your CI/CD</li>
<li>Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things
  "Not enough people in the open source community know how to use $X,
  but here's a tutorial on how to use $X to make your project better."</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past the devroom has seen both newbies/students and experienced professionals and
past speakers as part of the audience and talks covering from beginner/practical
to advanced/abstract topics. If you have doubts then submit your proposal and
leave a comment for the devroom managers and we'll get back to you.</p>
<p>To submit a talk proposal (you can submit multiple proposals if you'd like) use
<a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/">Pretalx</a>, the FOSDEM paper submission system.
Be sure to select <em>Testing and Continuous delivery</em>!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
starting today we are introducing several important changes to our subscription backend.</p>
<h2>New hub.kiwitcms.eu accounts</h2>
<p>Subscribers have the ability to access extra
<a href="/containers/">container images</a> via private docker repositories.</p>
<p><strong>What is changing:</strong> hub.kiwitcms.eu account username will no longer be based on email address,
instead it is based on the subscription ID which is more stable over time.
Discovering your credentials is explained on the page above.</p>
<p>New accounts have been created automatically for those eligible!
Old accounts will continue to be active until <strong>December 31st 2024</strong>,
afterwards they will be removed! Make sure to update your
workflows with the new credentials before December 31st!</p>
<h2>Automatic account creation for new subscriptions</h2>
<p>Previously subscribers who purchased a subscription were required to create
an account on <a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> using the same email address
used during their purchase.</p>
<p><strong>What is changing:</strong> user accounts for new subscriptions will be created automatically
if they do not exist and a random password would be assigned to them. Customers will
be able to reset passwords for these accounts via
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/accounts/passwordreset/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/accounts/passwordreset/</a>! The account username
is sent as a reminder in the password reset email!</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

                <h1 class="top-header">Managed Hosting Subscription Explained</h1>
            </a>

            <p class="post-meta">Posted by
                    <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/">Kiwi TCMS Team</a>
                on Wed 16 October 2024
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
our team has worked with our largest customers in order to better define what the
<em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription is and how it can bring more value beyond the
Kiwi TCMS application itself. You can read about the details below.</p>
<h2>What is Managed Hosting by Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>This is our top-tier of support services, where the Kiwi TCMS team leverages
our existing experience of hosting and running the Kiwi TCMS application
in production. It is more about <em>the batteries included</em> which make
overall operations easier, rather than specific software features.</p>
<h2>Who is this subscription for</h2>
<p><em>Managed Hosting</em> is suitable for large organizations which consider
their Kiwi TCMS instance to be a mission critical piece of infrastructure.
These are typically organizations with hundreds or thousands of testers
which have more requirements towards security and performance.</p>
<h2>What do you get</h2>
<p>Everything from lower tier subscription plans!</p>
<p>Most notably you get access to all versions of
community &amp; enterprise releases and a SaaS namespace which could be useful for in-house
development and experimentation with Kiwi TCMS. The SaaS version
(or a self-deployed enterprise version) can also be used as a sandbox instance to exercise
backwards compatibility testing against the latest version of Kiwi TCMS before
we upgrade your designated production instance!</p>
<h2>What do all of the individual items mean</h2>
<p><strong>1x Kiwi TCMS hosted in AWS:</strong> we've been running Kiwi TCMS in production since 2017 without
major incidents so far! This is lots of application and operation specific experience which
allows us to run a Kiwi TCMS instance securely and efficiently for you.
<em>Managed Hosting</em> frees up
your DevOps team from figuring it all out and lets them work on higher priority items.</p>
<p>Under this subscription you may chose one of
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/">Amazon Web Services regions</a>
if you have team members concentrated in a specific geographic area. There is no guarantee for the
actual underlying technology, e.g. EC2, ECS, Lightsail or other - this is up to us!</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Kiwi TCMS would adjust application size in order to meet your performance requirements
within reason. The total cost of all consumed cloud resources should still be covered by your
monthly payment. In extreme scenarios we would ask you to purchase a higher quantity
of the same subscription.</p>
<p>NOTICE: This subscription price is per instance! For distributed deployments across multiple
data centers you have to adjust the quantity of items on the subscription!</p>
<p><strong>Fully isolated instance:</strong> means exactly that - your database, web application and any additional
services (e.g. a Redis cache) will be completely isolated from resources provisioned for other customers
due to security concerns.</p>
<p>As part of the <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription you get an unlimited storage quota for
uploaded files and attachments. We may work with you to establish a data retention period if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Static files via global CDN:</strong> for <em>Managed Hosting</em> deployments all JavaScript, CSS
and related assets are served via a global content distribution network across hundreds of
edge locations in order to reduce latency and speed up page loading times in the browser.</p>
<p><strong>Email delivery via Amazon SES:</strong> depending on the amount of testing you perform Kiwi TCMS may be
sending lots of emails. Throughout the years we've observed that SMTP connections sometimes fail
resulting in unreliable service or email messages get marked as SPAM hurting the reputation of the sender.
This is also an area which requires prior configuration and does not work out of the box.</p>
<p><em>Managed Hosting</em> deployments use Amazon SES for email delivery which has the added benefit of
automatically managing blacklists when a delivery fails or is marked as SPAM. As part of
this subscription we will use an <code>@kiwitcms.org</code> email address authorized with Amazon SES!</p>
<p><strong>Delegated DNS &amp; SSL management:</strong> correct DNS and SSL configuration is vital for the
so called multi-tenant feature in Kiwi TCMS. This is the feature where you can create
unlimited namespaces of the type <code>team-1.tcms.example.com</code> and <code>product-2.tcms.example.com</code>
via the Kiwi TCMS web interface and have them available immediately.</p>
<p>A misconfigred DNS and/or misconfigured and/or expired SSL certificates is something that
happens regularly and leads to sub-optimal performance. With <em>Managed Hosting</em> we're going
to be managing all of this in the background.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: this requires that your company delegates an entire sub-domain, e.g.
<code>kiwitcms.example.com</code>, under our control!
If this isn't possible due to existing security policies we can configure a
<code>&lt;company&gt;.managed-hosting.kiwitcms.eu</code> DNS for you!</em></p>
<p><strong>Full application admin via web:</strong> as a customer you get the super-user account defined
in the Kiwi TCMS application and we promise that Kiwi TCMS staff will not login to minimize
the possibility of incidents. In any case we treat all of the data stored in a
<em>Managed Hosting</em> instance as confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Can override app/host settings:</strong> most of Kiwi TCMS' settings are not exposed via the web
interface and some customers find it cumbersome to override them. This is unfortunately
how the underlying application framework is designed to work. With a <em>Managed Hosting</em>
subscription our team will be taking care of this for you. This also extends to settings
of the underlying host system when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Kiwi TCMS upgrade upon request:</strong> currently an application upgrade involves human
interaction and is not something that can be automated as an unattended process.
Upgrading may also have implications towards backwards compatibility with 3rd
party systems and in-house software. That's why we would upgrade your instances
only after an explicit request and strive to keep downtime to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Regular security updates:</strong> relates to the underlying host OS (where applicable)
and web server configuration for Kiwi TCMS. With a <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription
our team will be keeping track of this for you. The underlying Postgres database
is not exposed via the Internet however we try to keep this up-to-date too!
Your InfoSec team is welcome to submit suggestions for improvements and we would
happily implement them where possible.</p>
<p><strong>Access to encrypted backups:</strong> our team performs regular backups for every Kiwi TCMS
instance within our care. All backups are encrypted using the popular open source tool
<a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>. This includes database and file uploads.</p>
<p>As part of the <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription we will work with your IT department and
provide you with shared access to these files in case you would like to keep your own
disaster recovery copy and/or to provision staging Kiwi TCMS instances with production like
data. Our team is open to further collaboration in this area!</p>
<p><strong>Extended support:</strong> as part of <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription you get more support coverage,
<em>07-22 UTC/Mon-Sun</em>, this is 3 hours extra and coverage over the weekends
plus a <em>video conference</em> option when necessary in order to resolve
requests faster.</p>
<p><strong>Custom long-term billing terms:</strong> we can adjust your payment schedule so that
it works best for you. For example weekly, monthly, every 3 or 6 months, every 1, 2 or 3 years!</p>
<h2>Mid-term plans</h2>
<p><strong>Distributed deployment:</strong> running the Kiwi TCMS application across multiple regions,
e.g. Europe, US, Asia, for customers with a global workforce and high performance requirements.
Requires that you adjust the quantity of items on the subscription!</p>
<p><strong>Access to monitoring tools:</strong> we're exploring how to securely provide access
for each customer to our existing monitoring tools and/or implement new ones where needed.
This will allow your DevOps team to scrutinize how well we are doing and
provide us with valuable feedback. Let us know what you would be interested to have access to!</p>
<h2>Long-term plans</h2>
<p><strong>Hosting on Red Hat Enterprise Linux:</strong> in some cases we are running containers directly
onto a bare-metal or virtualized machine. We are exploring the possibility of using
Red Hat Enterprise Linux throughout the entire hosting stack and tying this with
Red Hat's existing management infrastructure without adding extra charges towards
our customers.</p>
<p><strong>Red Hat Enterprise Linux package upgrades:</strong> will apply to both host OS (where applicable)
and the kiwitcms/enterprise container application which is already built on top of
<a href="https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi9-minimal/61832888c0d15aff4912fe0d">Red Hat UBI 9</a>
container image.</p>
<p><strong>Security certifications via NDA:</strong> our vision is to be able to securely share existing and
future security related certifications with our <em>Managed Hosting</em> customers under a
non-disclosure agreement. Ideally we would enroll provisioned instances into a penetration testing
program which will be provided by a 3rd party vendor. Let us know if you have specific suggestions here.</p>
<p><strong>24/7 support:</strong> the first step here will be to refactor our existing support program
and migrate to a ticket management system. Ideally such system will be open source too.
At a later date our goal is to have 24x7 coverage in order to minimize response times!</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

                    <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/">Kiwi TCMS Team</a>
                on Fri 23 February 2024
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Since the very beginning when we launched Kiwi TCMS our team has been struggling to
understand how many people use it, how active these users are, which pages &amp; functionality
they spend the most time with, how many installations of Kiwi TCMS are out there in the wild
and which exactly versions are the most used ones!</p>
<p>We reached over <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/11/08/kiwi-tcms-surpassed-2-million-downloads/">2 million downloads</a>
without any analytics inside the application because we do not want to intrude
on our users' privacy and this has not been easy! Inspired by
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3648-privacy-respecting-usage-metrics-for-free-software-projects/">a recent presentation</a>
we learned about Plausible Analytics - GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant, open source site analytics tool -
and decided to use it! You can check-out how it works <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics">here</a>.</p>
<h1>What is changing</h1>
<p>Starting with Kiwi TCMS v13.1 anonymous analytics will be enabled for statistical purposes.
Our goal is to track overall usage patterns inside the Kiwi TCMS application(s),
not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only.
No personal data is sent to Plausible.</p>
<p>Anonymous analytics are enabled on this website,
inside our <a href="/containers/">official container images</a> and for
all tenants provisioned under <code>https://*.tenant.kiwitcms.org</code>. Running containers
will report back to Plausible Analytics every 5 days to send the version number of Kiwi TCMS,
nothing else! Here's a preview of what it looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="&quot;preview of versions report&quot;" src="/images/analytics/preview_active_versions.png" title="preview of versions report"></p>
<p>You can examine our source code
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/3546">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/3547">here</a>.</p>
<p>Staying true to our open source nature we've made the
<a href="https://plausible.io/kiwitcms.org">kiwitcms.org stats dashboard</a> publicly available immediately!
In several months we are going to carefully examine the stats collected by the <em>kiwitcms-container</em> dashboard
and consider making them publicly available as well! Most likely we will!</p>
<h1>Who uses Plausible</h1>
<p>A number of [open source] organizations have publicly endorsed the use of Plausible Analytics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plausible Analytics - check-out <a href="https://plausible.io/plausible.io">their stats</a></li>

<li>System 76 - open source hardware vendor -

<li>The Scottish Government - <a href="https://www.gov.scot/privacy/">privacy policy</a>, stats not public</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also inspect this huge list of
<a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Plausible-Analytics">Websites using Plausible Analytics</a>
compiled by a 3rd party vendor!</p>
<h1>How can I opt-out</h1>
<ul>
<li>Leave everything as-is and help us better understand usage of Kiwi TCMS</li>
<li>Update the setting <code>PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN</code> and collect your own stats with Plausible</li>
<li>Update the setting <code>ANONYMOUS_ANALYTICS</code> to False and disable all stats</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Private Tenant customers and
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org">demo instance</a> users cannot opt-out! Given that they
are consuming digital resources hosted by our own team they have already shared
more information with us than what gets sent to Plausible!
Note that we do not track individual users, analyze or sell your information to 3rd parties
even across our own digital properties!</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong></p>
<p>The location of the Python runtime inside the container has changed.
This affects settings override files as well as any downstream customizations
to the Kiwi TCMS container image! For example you may have to adjust Docker
volumes like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w"> </span>        volumes:
<span class="gd">-            - ./local_settings.py:/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/tcms/settings/local_settings.py</span>
<span class="gi">+            - ./local_settings.py:/venv/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/tcms/settings/local_settings.py</span>
</pre></div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Explicitly define the <tt class="docutils literal">DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE</tt> setting. It controls
file uploads via RPC, not webUI, because the payload is base64 encoded and is
part of the request body. Closes

<li>Fix bug in search/display of Version on Search TestRun page. The root
cause was that the correct relationship here should have been
TR -&gt; Build -&gt; Version which is independent of the relationship
TP -&gt; Product -&gt; Version. Fixes
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/3258">Issue #3258</a></li>
<li>Fix bug in search/display of Product on Search TestRun page. The root
cause was that the correct relationship here should have been
TR -&gt; Build -&gt; Version -&gt; Product which is independent of the relationship
TP -&gt; Product</li>
<li>Fix Telemetry pages to query Product/Version from execution's data.
All of these underlying queries on these pages operate on TestExecution and
Product/Version information should be matched against what is stored in
TestExecution-&gt;Build because it is more accurate over time, while
TE-&gt;TR-&gt;TP-&gt;Product/Version is more likely to change as test plan
documents evolve</li>
<li>Adjust Product &amp; Version display on TestRun page using the relationship
TR-&gt;Build as the starting point</li>
<li>For IssueTracker integration use Product/Version from <tt class="docutils literal">execution.build</tt>
Note that <tt class="docutils literal">execution.build</tt> is initialized with <tt class="docutils literal">run.build</tt> and then may
change its value if we're recording results against multiple builds inside
the same TestRun. For example mark some executions as PASS, others as FAIL;
then update TR to a newer Build; retest and mark the FAIL results as PASS.
Using the value of <tt class="docutils literal">execution.build</tt> is more accurate</li>
<li>Treat the file <tt class="docutils literal">/Kiwi/etc/uwsgi.override</tt> as an ini file and load it if it
exists. This means that any override files must include the <tt class="docutils literal">[uwsgi]</tt>
section as well</li>

            <p>For a long time now Kiwi TCMS has supported integration with external issue tracking systems,
such as JIRA. This integration is usually configured via bot accounts and their respective
credentials and our flagship functionality is 1-click bug report! This is how it looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For any TestExecution click on the menu in the corner
<img alt="&quot;Corner menu for TestExecution&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_001.png" title="Corner menu for TestExecution"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select an existing Issue Tracker configuration and click <em>Report bug</em>
<img alt="&quot;1-click bug report button&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_002.png" title="1-click bug report button"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your browser will open a new window with the resulting report inside the external Issue Tracker
<img alt="&quot;Newly JIRA issue from a bot account&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_003.png" title="Newly JIRA issue from a bot account"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that <em>Reporter</em> (field 1) is <em>kiwitcms-bot</em> although the currently logged in user (field 2) is
different. The <em>Reporter</em> text reference (field 3) is the full name of the tester working on the Kiwi TCMS side
and may not match neither of fields 1 and 2! <strong>This presents a challenge if you are tracking any metrics
based on the actual <em>Reporter</em> field in JIRA.</strong></p>
<p>The new <strong>Personal API tokens</strong> functionality allows Kiwi TCMS users to override existing
issue tracker configurations with their own API credentials. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In JIRA click on your account and select <em>Manage account</em>
<img alt="&quot;Manage account menu in JIRA&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_004.png" title="Manage account menu in JIRA"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then select the <em>Security</em> tab
<img alt="&quot;Account page in JIRA&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_005.png" title="Account page in JIRA"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then click on <a href="https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens">Create and manage API tokens</a>
<img alt="&quot;Security tab of Account page in JIRA&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_006.png" title="Security tab of Account page in JIRA"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And create a new API token; Copy the token value for use inside Kiwi TCMS!
<img alt="&quot;API Tokens page in JIRA&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_007.png" title="API Tokens page in JIRA"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the Kiwi TCMS navigation menu select PLUGINS -&gt; Personal API tokens
<img alt="&quot;Navigate to Personal API tokens in Kiwi TCMS&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_008.png" title="Navigate to Personal API tokens in Kiwi TCMS"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select an existing Issue Tracker via its URL and fill-in your credentials. The drop-down choices
  represent all Issue Tracker records accessible to the current user across all tenants they are
  authorized for! For JIRA
  <code>api_username</code> is your JIRA email and <code>api_password</code> is your JIRA API token.
  Other issue trackers may only require the <code>api_password</code> field. The meaning of
  these fields can be found in
  <a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/tcms.issuetracker.html#submodules">documentation</a>
  for each different type of issue tracker that Kiwi TCMS can integrate with
<img alt="&quot;Create a new API token in Kiwi TCMS&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_009.png" title="Create a new API token in Kiwi TCMS"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the <em>1-click bug report</em> steps shown in the beginning.
  Your browser will open a new window with the resulting report inside JIRA
<img alt="&quot;New JIRA issue from your personal account&quot;" src="/images/features/personal-api-tokens/step_010.png" title="New JIRA issue from your personal account"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that <em>Reporter</em> (field 1), the currently logged in user (field 2) and
the <em>Reporter</em> text reference (field 3) now represent the same person!</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

<p>Attention testers! On behalf of the
<a href="https://fosdem-testingautomation.github.io/"><em>Testing and Continuous Delivery devroom</em></a>
we'd like to announce that call for participation is still open.
This room is about building better software through a focus on testing and
continuous delivery practices across all layers of the stack.
The purpose of this devroom is to share good and bad examples around the question
“how to improve quality of our software by automating tests, deliveries or deployments”
and to showcase new open source tools and practices.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> for FOSDEM 2024 this devroom is a merger between the former
<em>Testing and Automation</em> and <em>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</em> devrooms and
is jointly co-organized between devroom managers in previous FOSDEM editions!
Kiwi TCMS is proud to be part of the team hosting this devroom!</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> devroom will take place on Sunday, February 4th 2024 at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/practical/transportation/">ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium</a>!
Presentations will be streamed online but all accepted speakers are required to deliver
their talks in person!</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for topics that are a good fit for this devroom:</p>
<p>Testing in the real, open source world</p>
<ul>
<li>War stories/strategies for testing large scale or complex projects</li>
<li>Tools that extend the ability to test low-level code, e.g. bootloaders, init systems, etc.</li>
<li>Projects that are introducing new/interesting ways of testing "systems"</li>
<li>Address the automated testing frameworks fragmentation</li>
<li>Stories from end-users (e.g. success/failure)</li>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Continuous Deployment</li>
<li>Security in Software Supply Chain</li>
<li>Pipeline standardization</li>
<li>Interoperability in CI/CD</li>
<li>Lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)</p>
<ul>
<li>Project showcases, modern tooling</li>
<li>How your open source tool made developing quality software better</li>
<li>What tools do you use to setup your CI/CD</li>
<li>Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things
  "Not enough people in the open source community know how to use $X,
  but here's a tutorial on how to use $X to make your project better."</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past the devroom has seen both newbies/students and experienced professionals and
past speakers as part of the audience and talks covering from beginner/practical
to advanced/abstract topics. If you have doubts then submit your proposal and
leave a comment for the devroom managers and we'll get back to you.</p>
<p>To submit a talk proposal (you can submit multiple proposals if you'd like) use
<a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/">Pretalx</a>, the FOSDEM paper submission system.
Be sure to select <em>Testing and Continuous delivery</em>!</p>

<p>We are happy to share that Kiwi TCMS has surpassed 2 million downloads on Docker Hub.
At the time of writing this blog post the exact number is <em>2004544</em>!
We say a big THANK YOU you to our entire community!</p>
<p>As luck would have it we were able to announce this achievement at the annual
<a href="https://www.openfest.org">OpenFest</a> conference in Bulgaria and celebrate the day with
not one, but two kiwi bird mascots.

<p>The <a href="https://www.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a> is a public research university
in Salt Lake City, USA. It is the flagship institution of the
Utah System of Higher Education and was established in 1850.</p>
<p>The University of Utah's
<a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/">School of Computing</a>, founded as the Computer Science Department
in 1965, has a long and distinguished record of high impact research.
The university has provided large, automated testbeds since around the year 2000,
funded by the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.flux.utah.edu/">Flux Research Group</a> conducts research in operating systems,
networking, security, and virtualization. The group consists of three faculty and over
two dozen research staff, graduate students, and undergrads.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.powderwireless.net/">POWDER</a>
(the Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven Experimental Research) is flexible infrastructure
enabling a wide range of software-defined experiments on the future of wireless networks.
POWDER supports software-programmable experimentation on 5G and beyond, massive MIMO, ORAN,
spectrum sharing and CBRS, RF monitoring,
and anything else that can be supported on software-defined radios.</p>
<p>In the words of David M. Johnson, research staff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The addition of Kiwi TCMS to our POWDER mobile wireless testbed helps to support
the complex multi-system, end-to-end functional test and integration scenarios
we see in the 5G/O-RAN/beyond mobile wireless space.</p>
<p>We use Kiwi TCMS as part of an on-demand environment that POWDER provides to users
that can help them automate testing using a workflow approach,
from CI-triggered orchestration from scratch in our cloud-like environment,
through resource configuration and running test suites,
to finally collecting results into private instances of Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<p>We use both the Stackstorm and Dagster workflow engines to execute our test and integration workflows.
The <a href="https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/powder-workflows/stackstorm-kiwitcms">stackstorm-kiwitcms</a>
library is a simple Stackstorm "integration pack"
(Python source code in this case) that invokes and re-exports much of the core Kiwi TCMS XML-RPC API
(with some minor sugar) into Stackstorm, so that each API function is exposed as a Stackstorm action
(the fundamental unit of its workflows). This means that the workflows can orchestrate resources
into test scenarios; configure the resources; create or instantiate Kiwi TCMS test runs/executions/metadata;
execute tests; and push test results/status into Kiwi TCMS records, upload attachments, etc, for persistence.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/powderrenewpublic/kiwi">a fork</a> of Kiwi TCMS right now
so that we could upload attachments to test runs via the API.
That was a trivial change which
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/9344e2873a48da477ac565362689e4851c34214e">made its way upstream</a>
as part of Kiwi TCMS version 12.1.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p><a href="https://www.offsec.com/">OffSec</a> is an American international company working
in information security, penetration testing and digital forensics. Operating
from around 2007, the company has created multiple open source projects,
advanced security courses, the ExploitDB vulnerability database, and the popular Kali Linux.
It has recently released the Kali Purple platform, a dedicated platform for
cyber defence analysts and a platform for security services.</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.offsec.com/library/all/new-releases/modal/module/introduction-to-assurance-testing/">Introduction to Assurance Testing</a>
is a brand new training course covering the defensive testing techniques used
to establish a level of assurance that your server is secure. It is the first
course of OffSec’s OSDA cyber defence learning path. This course introduces the
context for security testing and explains how security testing aligns to the business.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 3: Creating and Using Security Test Documentation explains the documentation
used in security related testing and introduces Kiwi TCMS as the test management tool of choice!</em>
<img alt="&quot;Kiwi TCMS as shown in OffSec's training materials&quot;" src="/images/offsec_chapter3_kiwitcms.png" title="Kiwi TCMS as shown in OffSec's training materials"></p>
<p>The course is part of Offsec’s fundamentals package which is designed as baseline knowledge
and skills for all security professionals and in particular for those who wish to progress
to the OffSec Defence Analyst (OSDA) certification.  The Assurance Testing course,
and the Kiwi TCMS tool which it uses, gives developers and security testers alike a good
understanding of the best practice approach to test case management and helps build their
skills in carrying out testing in a disciplined way. Using Kiwi TCMS provides the
opportunity to improve the processes and documentation around security testing,
and around the wider functional testing as well.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS bridges the gap between security requirements and software development by
enabling standardized test cases to be developed by the security team whilst
software developers and dedicated QA teams can use these same test cases to ensure that
security requirements are met. With preset test plans and test cases,
execution of security tests can proceed in the same way as for any other non-functional testing,
and any issues identified during testing can be fixed and tests can be executed again.</p>
<p>Learning how to use Kiwi TCMS as part of the Introduction to Assurance Testing course helps
both security teams and QA teams work together in a common environment to improve
the quality and security of their software. Using Kiwi TCMS enables security teams to
provide clear instructions to QA teams as to how to use specialist security testing tools.
For example, having clear test cases for running the PowerShell audit tool
for the Active Directory Certificate Server, PSPKIAudit, means that the test team can take advantage
of a powerful testing tool without needing the specialist knowledge that might otherwise be required
to use and interpret the results of such a tool.</p>
