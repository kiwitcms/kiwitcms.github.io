<p>Attention testers! On behalf of the
<a href="https://fosdem-testingautomation.github.io/"><em>Testing and Continuous Delivery devroom</em></a>
we'd like to announce that call for participation is still open.
This room is about building better software through a focus on testing and
continuous delivery practices across all layers of the stack.
The purpose of this devroom is to share good and bad examples around the question
‚Äúhow to improve quality of our software by automating tests, deliveries or deployments‚Äù
and to showcase new open source tools and practices.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> for FOSDEM 2024 this devroom is a merger between the former
<em>Testing and Automation</em> and <em>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</em> devrooms and
is jointly co-organized between devroom managers in previous FOSDEM editions!
Kiwi TCMS is proud to be part of the team hosting this devroom!</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> devroom will take place on Sunday, February 4th 2024 at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/practical/transportation/">ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium</a>!
Presentations will be streamed online but all accepted speakers are required to deliver
their talks in person!</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for topics that are a good fit for this devroom:</p>
<p>Testing in the real, open source world</p>
<ul>
<li>War stories/strategies for testing large scale or complex projects</li>
<li>Tools that extend the ability to test low-level code, e.g. bootloaders, init systems, etc.</li>
<li>Projects that are introducing new/interesting ways of testing "systems"</li>
<li>Address the automated testing frameworks fragmentation</li>
<li>Stories from end-users (e.g. success/failure)</li>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Continuous Deployment</li>
<li>Security in Software Supply Chain</li>
<li>Pipeline standardization</li>
<li>Interoperability in CI/CD</li>
<li>Lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)</p>
<ul>
<li>Project showcases, modern tooling</li>
<li>How your open source tool made developing quality software better</li>
<li>What tools do you use to setup your CI/CD</li>
<li>Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things
  "Not enough people in the open source community know how to use $X,
  but here's a tutorial on how to use $X to make your project better."</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past the devroom has seen both newbies/students and experienced professionals and
past speakers as part of the audience and talks covering from beginner/practical
to advanced/abstract topics. If you have doubts then submit your proposal and
leave a comment for the devroom managers and we'll get back to you.</p>
<p>To submit a talk proposal (you can submit multiple proposals if you'd like) use
<a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/">Pretalx</a>, the FOSDEM paper submission system.
Be sure to select <em>Testing and Continuous delivery</em>!</p>

<p>Attention testers! On behalf of
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/"><em>Testing and Automation devroom</em></a>
we'd like to announce that the final program for the devroom is ready!</p>
<p>We received over 30 submissions this year and the entire collection of topics was extremely good.
During FOSDEM we are going to see topics around functional testing for the Linux kernel,
growing testing infrastructure for Linux, testing of new networking protocols, observability-driven
development, the testing history behind the GNOME desktop environment, property-based testing
and mutation testing.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> devroom will take place 09:00 to 12:50, Sunday, February 5th 2023 at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/practical/transportation/">ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>If you are around don't forget to check-out our friends from the
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/continuous_integration_and_continuous_deployment/">Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment devroom</a>

<p>If you are a test or QA engineer please answer our survey
<a href="https://forms.gle/LTYnimNjbUaSmTeL8">https://forms.gle/LTYnimNjbUaSmTeL8</a>. Participants may claim a small surprise at our booth!</p>
<h2>For startups</h2>
<p>We know that in a startup, the major strength of the people is that they are multitaskers.
And it is often the case that the founders will perform some functional and acceptance testing
because they know all the important use-cases.</p>
<p>Still you need to document and organize your testing activities early on. You need to
start collecting information about which features of the product have been tested and
how they have been tested. That's the basis on which you can scale your QA team and
future testing activities.</p>
<p>If you are a fellow startup exhibitor please swing by out stand to talk about
organizing your product testing with Kiwi TCMS. We know the drill because we're in
the same boat!</p>
<h2>For partners</h2>
<p>If you are another ISV providing engineering tools, a product outsourcing company
or a devel/testing service venture we've got a partnership proposal for you!</p>
<p>We're interested in partners where we can integrate other products with Kiwi TCMS
and provide a better offering; provide extra services (e.g. managed hosting) and/or
provide more transparency to your own customers (e.g. allow them to see how their products
are being tested).</p>
<p>Message us via the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collision">Collision app</a>
and request a meeting or better yet, find our team on-site!</p>
<h2>Virtual press conference</h2>
<p>If you aren't around in Toronto please join us for a pre 2022 Collision News Conference (VIRTUAL) on
<strong>Wednesday, June 15, 1:00 - 2:00 p.m. EDT / 17:00 - 18:00 UTC</strong>.</p>

<p>Attention testers! On behalf of
<a href="https://fosdem-testingautomation.github.io/"><em>Testing and Automation devroom</em></a>
we'd like to announce that call for participation is now open.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for topics that are a good fit for this devroom:</p>
<p>Testing in the real, open source world</p>
<ul>
<li>War stories/strategies for testing large scale or complex projects</li>
<li>Demystify resource e.g. systems/device/cloud provisioning in a CI loop</li>
<li>Tools that extend the ability to test low-level code, e.g. bootloaders, init
systems, etc.</li>
<li>Projects that are introducing new/interesting ways of testing "systems"</li>
<li>Address the automated testing frameworks fragmentation</li>
<li>Lessons learned from testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)</p>
<ul>
<li>How your open source tool made developing quality software better</li>
<li>What tools do you use to setup your CI/CD</li>
<li>Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things "Not enough people in
the open source community know how to use $X, but here's a tutorial on how to
use $X to make your project better."</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past the devroom has seen both newbies/students and experienced professionals and
past speakers as part of the audience and talks covering from beginner/practical
to advanced/abstract topics. If you have doubts then submit your proposal and
leave a comment for the devroom managers and we'll get back to you.</p>
<p>Checkout
<a href="https://fosdem-testingautomation.github.io/">https://fosdem-testingautomation.github.io/</a> for more information!</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

            <p>Kiwi TCMS is happy to announce that our first post-COVID live presence
will be at <a href="https://websummit.com/">WebSummit 2021</a>, Nov 1-4 in Lisbon, Portugal.
We're joining as a <a href="https://websummit.com/startups/featured-startups">featured startup</a>
as part of the ALPHA program in category <em>Enterprise Software Solutions</em>.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS will have an on-site presence during the exhibition (1 day) where you can
easily find us. We've also applied to the
<a href="https://websummit.com/startups/startup-showcase">Startup Showcase</a> track where you can
see Alex present on stage. In addition, if all goes
well our team will be joined by Alexandre Neto of QCooperative who is leading
the effort to adopt Kiwi TCMS for testing the QGIS open source project. More on that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wob_L_SrEwE">here</a>.</p>
<p>Exact schedules are still unknown at this stage so you will have to ping us via email/Twitter
or find us on the conference floor if you want to meet.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Next month our team will be at
<a href="https://pyconbalkan.com/">PyCon Balkan, Oct 3-5</a> in Belgrade. Together with
presentation and a workshop we are going to host open source sprints!
These will be an informal gathering where participants will be able to
learn more about how open source works and go through their first
contributions. This is ideal for students and less experienced people
but we welcome everyone. There will be tasks ranging from easy to very hard!</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> 4 mentors from Kiwi TCMS and you!</p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> full day of peer programming and contributing to Kiwi TCMS</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> room will be announced on the days of the conference,
           follow <a href="https://twitter.com/KiwiTCMS">@KiwiTCMS</a> for more info</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> up your tech skills, build your GitHub profile and have fun together</p>
<h2>Translate Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>We have enabled Serbian language in our translation system. To get started
checkout our
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html#translation">translation contribution</a>
page.
Once strings are translated <code>kiwitcms-bot</code> will automatically open a pull
request with the new text.</p>
<h2>Find unused CSS classes</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>This should be relatively easy. For each class/selector defined in our CSS files
search (grep) if any of the HTML templates use it. If it is not in use then remove
it.</p>
<h2>Find unused JavaScript code</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Similar to the above. We're not 100% certain but there could be legacy JavaScript
functions which are no longer in use. Find them and remove them! At the very least
you have confirmed that all functions are in use!</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Minor severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy to moderate</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=minor&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Minor severity issues</a>.
There are many of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS lint issues (we suggest you start with this one)</li>
<li>functions longer than 25 lines of code</li>
<li>functions with bigger cognitive and cyclomatic complexity</li>
<li>modules longer than 250 LOC</li>
</ul>
<p>Try fixing a few to see how it goes and continue if you feel confident.
Not everything may be an issue so if you have any questions ask someone from our team.</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Major severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: moderate to hard</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=major&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Major severity issues</a>.
There are around 150 of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>identical and similar code blocks</li>
<li>big modules</li>
<li>big functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these require some sort of refactoring, either splitting snippets
of code into smaller pieces (functions or sub-modules) or using one function
in several places instead of 2 very similar but different functions, etc.
Ask our team members about which approach they prefer for fixing these issues
to minimize the effort spent here.</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Critical severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: hard</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=critical&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Critical severity issues</a>.
All of these are functions with high cognitive complexity and
the recommended way to deal with them is refactoring into
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/">class based views</a>.</p>
<h2>Improve pylint health</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Execute pylint against the latest sources and start fixing the issues.
Looking at <a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/579167487">pylint logs</a> the
following items are relatively easy to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything in module tcms.urls</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.telemetry.api</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.testruns.tests.test_views</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.xmlrpc.forms</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.testcases.tests.test_models</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.core.forms.fields</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.settings.common</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.settings.test</li>
<li>All <code>module-in-directory-without-init</code> errors reported for module tcms.tests.__init__</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <code>fixme</code>, <code>missing-permission-required</code> and <code>avoid-auto-field</code> errors are usually harder
to resolve and will require more work/refactoring. If you feel confident go ahead and
fix them, if not skip to the next error message.</p>
<p>We also use a custom pylint checker which reports function based views.
If you are looking for something harder to work on, then give it a try
(see 3rd pylint line in <code>Makefile</code>) and refactor some of the existing
view functions into class based views.</p>
<h2>Fix 3rd party security issues discovered by Bandit</h2>
<p>Difficulty: moderate to hard</p>
<p>Bandit is a static analysis tool similar to pylint. It focuses on discovering
issues which may lead to security vulnerabilities. We have resolved all such
issues in our own source code but we also execute Bandit against the entire
Python dependency stack. There it finds thousands of issues, so much so that
the reporter crashes.</p>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/579167486">In CI</a> there are around
130 issues reported. The best course of action here is to execute Bandit locally
against the offending library and then figure out what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>report an issue upstream</li>
<li>send a pull request upstream</li>
<li>if these are test files maybe exclude them from the package (e.g. don't ship them for production)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: inside Travis CI we have all runtime and testing dependencies which is more
than what we have inside the official Docker image for Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<h2>Work on reported issues</h2>
<p>The following issues look suitable for a sprint and don't require lots of
background knowledge. You can also find them using the
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/labels/PyConBalkan"><code>PyConBalkan</code></a> label on
GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/212">#212</a> - moderate - Convert jQ to $ -
  this is an easy search &amp; rename but will require more extensive manual testing</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/431">#431</a> - moderate to hard - Remove JavaScript fireEvent() -
  17 matches in <code>static/js/</code>. Must be replaced with direct function calls</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/652">#652</a> - easy - Removal of labels from form fields -
  all labels must be included in the HTML template and marked for translation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/681">#681</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/682">#682</a> - moderate -
  Move API modules &amp; their tests from <code>xmlrpc/api/&lt;app&gt;.py</code> to <code>&lt;app&gt;/api.py</code>. These have good test
  coverage so you have to make sure you don't break anything</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/971">#971</a> - moderate - manage.py command for changing Site URL -
  will help with automatic provisioning, e.g. Ansible. For howto see
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/custom-management-commands/">Django docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1021">#1021</a> - moderate - Update TestCase page UI to allow adding TestPlans to cases -

<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/13/taking-the-lead-at-openexpo-europe-cfp-votes/">took the lead at OpenExpo 2019 CfP votes</a>.
We need your help one more time. Our team has submitted participation in
'Best Tech Community' and 'Best Success Story' categories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our submission into 'Best Success Story' has been pulled down!
We used that category to share the story from a dead open source project into
a thriving open source community with lots of users and contributors and to
highlight some of our milestones. Here's the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of technical updates and refactoring, latest everything, modern UI</li>
<li>the <strong>only</strong> open source test case management system on GitHub Marketplace</li>
<li>nearly 60000 downloads on Docker Hub</li>
<li>growing and active core team</li>
<li>active OSS contributors</li>
</ul>

            <p>On Tuesday I hosted my pylint workshop during the regular
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/295673718035353/">Django Bulgaria meetup</a>.
This edition was the first which was practice based.</p>
<p>Attendance numbers were low but participation was very good. We managed to
create 4 new checkers for Kiwi TCMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/949">PR #949 - AutoField checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/950">PR #950 - OneToOneField checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/951">PR #951 - discover directories without __init__.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/952">PR #952 - empty class checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/955">PR #955 - function based view checker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to all contributors. These new checkers have discovered quite a
few new issues with Kiwi TCMS so this is an area which our team is going to improve.</p>
<p>Those who missed the workshop will be able to catch up one of the next editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>26-29 August, GUADEC, Thessaloniki - TBC (presentation)</li>
<li>end of September, Python meetup, Zagreb - TBA</li>
<li>03-05 October, PyCon Balkan, Belgrade - TBC</li>
<li>11-13 October, HackConf, Sofia</li>
<li>15-17 October, TestCon Europe, Vilnius - TBC (backup presentation)</li>
<li>23-25 October, Testwarez, Ossa, Poland - TBC (presentation)</li>
<li>14-15 November, Software Engineering Conference Russia, Saint-Petersburg - TBC</li>
