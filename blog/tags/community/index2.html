                on Sat 02 March 2019
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="/images/team/hiring_banner.png" style="float:none;clear-both;margin:0;max-width: 100%"></p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to be part of an open source team?
Have you ever wanted to contribute back the open source community ?
Have you ever wanted to see your code used by thousands of people ?</p>
<p>If yes now you have the opportunity! Read on to learn how you can help
Kiwi TCMS and how our team can help you.</p>
<h2>Inexperienced Python developer(s)</h2>
<p>It is fine not to have any experience at all! You will compensate with
commitment and hard work. Initially you are going to work on refactoring,
cleaning up pylint errors, removing duplicate code and other issues
reported by <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a>.</p>
<p>By doing this you will have the opportunity to learn git, Python, Django,
some CSS, JavaScript and Patternfly HTML of course. We are going to provide
you with all the learning materials plus help and guidance from existing team members.</p>
<p>Everyone on the team has gone though the same training procedure and grueling tasks
and so will you! Once you can demonstrate progress and learn the ropes you
will continue working on more complicated tasks.</p>
<h2>Experienced Python developer(s)</h2>
<p>So you have some experience already, you've probably contributed code before and are
now looking for more green stripes on your GitHub profile. We've got you covered!</p>
<p>There are many areas to choose from: issue tracker integration, GitHub integration,
GitLab integration, external API library, Kiwi TCMS plugins written in Python and
customized pylint linters! This is going to be where you get your hands dirty and
show your strengths. Our team is here to help if necessary but we expect you to
show progress by yourself.</p>
<p>A challenge for you will be to review pull requests from other contributors and
be patient with less experienced contributors and team members. This is an excellent
opportunity to work on your people skills as well.</p>
<h2>Experienced non-Python developer(s) (with Java)</h2>
<p>Kiwi TCMS is primarily looking for Java developers who will own our test automation
plugins. Currently we have a plugin for JUnit 5 and TestNG is in planning. Maybe
there will be a plugin for Jenkins as well. You are going to own these components
and work solely on them. Unless you decide to learn Python and Django that would
be a very easy job!</p>
<p>.NET, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript ? We don't have a lot of code written in these languages
but you can help change this. The main thing we'd like you to know
(or become familiar with) are the internals of popular test automation frameworks
for these languages and how to create plugins for them.</p>
<h2>QA engineer with Python</h2>
<p>You are going to test a lot! You are going to write test automation a lot! Ideally you
already have a medium level of experience in the software testing field and
want to improve your coding skills and/or get more experience into a different
application domain. We also have Linux and Docker in the mix, just for fun!</p>
<p>Your responsibility will be to design test scenarios for various features (new or existing),
write test automation scripts and help improve overall test coverage and quality
of Kiwi TCMS. You will also check-in on non-Python developers and
help them with test design when necessary.</p>
<p>There are other things that can be tested as well, for example Kiwi TCMS
performance and scalability. Here you will have to get down to the nitty-gritty
stuff and do some profiling to pin-point where the root cause of the problem is.</p>
<h2>Security freak</h2>
<p>We've got <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/kiwitcms-kiwi">Coverity scan</a> and
<a href="https://snyk.io/test/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">Snyk</a> automatically inspecting our
code base. We do have some other tools as well and we know they can never be enough.</p>
<p>You will be responsible for triaging the numerous issues being reported by these
tools and help us decide if they are a real threat or a false positive. For example
Coverity reports hundreds of issues mostly coming from our Python and Node.js dependency
stack. We haven't had the time to classify them and work with upstream communities
to fix them thus the majority of your contributions will be outside of the
Kiwi TCMS code base.</p>
<h2>Graphics designer</h2>
<p>Your main job is going to be creating beautiful images for our website,
blog posts and promotional material. All the images we use are licensed under
Creative Commons which we then modify with the specific Kiwi TCMS look and
feel. This is not going to change, your work will remain under a permissive
license!</p>
<h2>Marketing specialist</h2>
<p>You will be directly responsible for driving more traffic to our website,
interpreting Google Analytics metrics and coming up with creative ideas
how to boost Kiwi TCMS popularity. This means, but not limited to blog posts,
collaborations with other projects and/or bloggers, professional magazines, etc.
You will also be in charge of events and conferences that we go to! Whenever
possible you will be coming with us as well!</p>
<p>A challenge for you will be to learn some technical jargon and learn more
about the software testing profession and software testers in general!</p>
<h2>What's in it for you ?</h2>
<p>You will sharpen your skills! You will use Kiwi TCMS as a platform to
improve your career. You will experience the gratification of our community of users.</p>
<p>This blog is the medium where you can share tips
and tricks and technical articles about interesting features in Kiwi TCMS.
If you'd rather have your personal blog working on Kiwi TCMS will give you lots
of topics to write about.</p>
<p>We go to conferences and meetups too. If public speaking is your thing
you will have plenty of topics to talk about. We can also help you
deliver your first presentation! Everyone on the team has done it!</p>
<p>Our existing team will help you learn and we will help you grow. Our personal time
is the most expensive item we can offer to you! In return we expect you to
fulfill your commitments and when you promise something will be done you will
make sure it is done!</p>
<h2>How to apply ?</h2>
<p>You can figure this out yourself.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p class="post-meta">Posted by
                    <a href="/blog/atodorov/">Alexander Todorov</a>
                on Fri 22 February 2019
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>In
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/02/01/kiwi-tcms-65/">release notes for v6.5</a>
we announced several plugins which will fetch test names and execution results
from your automated test suite.</p>
<p>Plugins can be controlled via environment variables which will affect how
test results are recorded in the Kiwi TCMS database! This blog post is an introduction
how that works and what you can do with it! For this purpose I will be using the
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo">plugin-demo</a> repository, which simulates
real development work.</p>
<p><em>Full documentation and list of available plugins is available in chapter
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html">Automation Frameworks Plugins</a>!</em></p>
<h2>Always create new TestRun by default</h2>
<p>The default behavior is always to create a new TestRun if controlling variables
are not overridden! Product name, version and build will receive default values
if tests are running in Travis CI or Jenkins. For example
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496217246">Travis Build #2</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/d455fb42fb7c2aedadfd5f66de7d131109c03350">commit d455fb4</a>
creates <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/12/">TR-12</a> and
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/10/">TP-10</a>!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=d455fb42fb7c2aedadfd5f66de7d131109c03350</span>
<span class="err">Build=2</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Next we convert the README file from Markdown to reStructuredText which triggers
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496220575">Travis Build #3</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/418b80b3bbb65a799f695dc59d488c76f560fa2b">commit 418b80b</a>.
This build <strong>again</strong> creates a new TestRun and new TestPlan for it. Respectively
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/14/">TR-14</a> and
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/12/">TP-12</a>!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=418b80b3bbb65a799f695dc59d488c76f560fa2b</span>
<span class="err">Build=3</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p><strong>Important:</strong> we can see that version is different which will affect how artifacts
are organized in Kiwi TCMS, possibly affect how you will report status to stakeholders!</p>
<h2>Override ENV variables for more control</h2>
<p>Let's say the QA team has decided that all test results must be reported under the
same TestPlan. This means version must be the same between various builds in Travis CI!
To control this we export <code>TCMS_PRODUCT_VERSION=master</code> in CI <strong>before</strong> executing
the TAP plugin! Checkout the commit on GitHub to see how it is done!</p>
<p>This triggers
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496223505">Travis Build #4</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/e484e59023caf665e8f93341395af6f397691b93">commit e484e59</a>.
Because this is the first time where Version == master the plugin creates
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a> and reports the results under
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/16/">TR-16</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=master</span>
<span class="err">Build=4</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Right after that I realized we can make this configuration a bit more generic
because our team is planning to support multiple versions of the product and
development will be done in separate branches!
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496228021">Travis Build #5</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/f1f2878d80a7327b54c8e33d1c6d6f14153d6d12">commit f1f2878</a>
still ends up with Version == master because we are still working on the <code>master</code>
branch! That is to say, the product is in active mode of development.</p>
<p>Results are reported in
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/18/">TR-18</a> which is again part of
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=master</span>
<span class="err">Build=5</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496229819">Travis Build #6</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/df6153b2495bfc6825f25e544ae1806108aa490f">commit df6153b</a>
adds the new functionality <em>README badges</em> and reports test results in
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/20/">TR-20</a> which is again part of
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<h2>More ENV overrides</h2>
<p>While giving status reports back to stakeholders and developers the information that
we have in the TestRun is Build number! This follows the numbering scheme in Travis CI
(or Jenkins job number) and isn't very useful.</p>
<p>Let's define <code>TCMS_BUILD</code> to be the first 7 characters of the commit hash! When QA
tells devel that something isn't working and redirects them to the TestRun they can
immediately use the Build information and git checkout the offending variant of the product
for investigation.</p>
<p>This results in
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496233565">Travis Build #7</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/bf75d0abe9695e3ee3b49b8944bab9db43bb25e6">commit bf75d0a</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/22/">TR-22</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=master</span>
<span class="err">Build=bf75d0a</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Report results in pre-existing TestRun</h2>
<p>There are many reasons you may want to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>include both manual and automation tests for the same build;</li>
<li>mix results from multiple test suites for the same build,
  e.g. unit, functional, performance</li>
<li>mix results from multiple but similar platforms in the same build,
  e.g. cross-platform application for iOS and Android</li>
</ul>
<p>To do so I've created <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/24/">TR-24</a> beforehand and
configured <code>TCMS_RUN_ID=24</code> in my CI environment. TR-24 also contains
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/case/57/">TC-57: Verify we can report results from several plugins into the same TR</a>.
this was created and added via the web interface.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> mixing additional test cases can be done either before or after
automation results are reported with the plugin!</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> when reporting results to an existing TestRun Kiwi TCMS plugins
don't care in which TestPlan this TR is! In theory it is possible to report
the results for <code>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</code> into any TP/TR pair! However we
don't want to do this crazy thing and instead I've created TR-24 inside the already
existing TP-14!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> because I don't know what is the git commit beforehand I've configured
TR-24 with <code>Build=unspecified</code>. If I wanted I could update this with the correct value
once I know the commit hash for the related changes I am testing.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> the plugin-demo repository uses both kiwitcms-tap-plugin and
kiwitcms-junit.xml-plugin at the same time! They differ in the way test names
are compiled! Both are reported in TR-24. See TC-57 text for information how to
distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496237911">Travis Build #8</a> for
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496237911">commit 85ad939</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/24/">TR-24</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=master</span>
<span class="err">Build=unspecified</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Also check-out comments in TR executions to see when and who had executed the test case.</p>
<p>So far there have been some tests which were failing (although Travis reports PASS) so
I decided to fix them.
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496240713">Travis Build #9</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/a25b3841e656d47a7539c608e375cecbf3bed2ac">commit a25b384</a>
is still configured with <code>TCMS_RUN_ID=24</code>. This means results will be reported in
TR-24, effectively overwriting previous results.</p>
<p>Check-out <em>Change Log</em> under each individual execution and you will see several
time stamps when status was updated! In other words, as long as <code>TCMS_RUN_ID</code> is
pointing to an existing TestRun this TR will keep the results of the last test suite execution!</p>
<h2>Continue development, restore ENV configuration</h2>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496243124">Travis Build #10</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/c4f1ae5ecadb249d39923cedbbf53a85e50420b3">commit c4f1ae5</a>
removes <code>TCMS_RUN_ID</code>! Results are reported in
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/25/">TR-25</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=master</span>
<span class="err">Build=c4f1ae5</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Branch out for an LTS version</h2>
<p>Our team has decided to make the first LTS release of the product. We branch out into
<code>lts-v0</code> branch in git and cut the first NVR. This results in
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496245067">Travis Build #11</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/9f1ef717e3fb248d65535ed66b5c4e61e6f85a6e">commit 9f1ef71</a>
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/27/">TR-27</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/16/">TP-16</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=lts-v0</span>
<span class="err">Build=9f1ef71</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Because this is the first time we are running tests for this product version
we end up with the newly created TP-16!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> see how version was populated with the correct value for the git branch!
This is because my CI config uses <code>TCMS_PRODUCT_VERSION=$TRAVIS_BRANCH</code> and no further
changes were required! I made this change back in Travis Build #5 anticipating what
will come in the future!</p>
<p>The product is now live and customers have reported critical bugs for it:
<em>URLs for the badges in README are wrong</em>! I fix those and add more tests of course, see:
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496247347">Travis Build #12</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/2d72754d3f911ef4e25287f203471f4466b95d12">commit 2d72754</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/29/">TR-29</a> for
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/16/">TP-16</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</span>
<span class="err">Version=lts-v0</span>
<span class="err">Build=2d72754</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>TR-29 contains the new <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/case/58/">TC-58</a>!</p>
<h2>cherry-pick between branches</h2>
<p>In the <code>lts-v0</code> branch customers have identified a serious issue. It doesn't exist on <code>master</code>
but the test is still valid so I cherry-pick it! In git you can backport or forwardport very
easily. Regardless of the direction Kiwi TCMS plugins will record the test results for you.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496252529">Travis Build #13</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/31ae5b3358137fde7d2b5c3656b384acc7331d95">commit 31ae5b3</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/31/">TR-31</a> for
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<p>We can see that TC-58, which was originally implemented on the <code>lts-v0</code> branch
is now present!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a very basic example of how you can organize collection and reporting for
your automation test suite results with Kiwi TCMS. The links here only refer to
artifacts created by <code>kiwitcms-tap-plugin</code> while in the DB we keep others as well.</p>
<p>There are feature requests for more ENV variables which will allow you to control
TestPlan creation and child/parent relationship between test plans. See
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/tap-plugin/issues">https://github.com/kiwitcms/tap-plugin/issues</a> and vote with a <code>:+1:</code> reaction
to help us plan for these features.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS automation framework plugins are nothing more than result parsers
which talk back to a database. It is up to you to decide how to organize the
collection of test results and how to report on them later, when the need arises.</p>
<p>Future installments in this post series will take a look at workflows with
feature branches and pull requests and discuss possible organization scenarios.
You are welcome to share your ideas in the comments below.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers, Kiwi TCMS has taken on a brave new
mission! We would like to transform the testing process by making it more
organized, transparent &amp; accountable for everyone on your team. Our goal
is to improve engineering productivity and participation in
testing. The following blog post outlines how we would like to achieve
this and what goals we put before ourselves for this year.</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p>Last year we took on the challenge to bring a legacy code base up to modern
coding standard. We did not complete that effort but made very good progress
along the way. This is not a small task and that's why our team will continue
with it this year.</p>
<p><img src="/images/codeclimate_jan_2019.png" style="float:none"
     alt="CodeClimate report" title="CodeClimate report"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a>:
  0 issues, 0% technical debt, health score A</li>
<li><a href="https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/kiwitcms/Kiwi/">Scrutinizer</a>:
  only A and B type issues</li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/475946313">Pylint</a>: 0 issues</li>
<li>Remove vendored-in Handlebars, jQuery, jQuery-UI and TableDnD JavaScript
  libraries in favor of existing npm dependencies</li>
<li>Front-end uses the existing JSON-RPC instead of backend views that
  are only used for AJAX requests. Tip: these are usually accessed via
  <code>postToURL()</code> and <code>jQ.ajax()</code> on the front-end</li>
<li>Inspect and classify all 3rd party issues reported from
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/kiwitcms-kiwi">Coverity</a> and
  <a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/475946312">Bandit</a>. Report and fix
  what we can, ignore the rest that do not affect Kiwi TCMS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p>There are 59 templates remaining to be converted to a modern look and feel.
Along with them comes more refactoring and even redesign of the existing pages
and the workflow around them. Together with refactoring this will make Kiwi TCMS
easier to use and also to maintain.</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting</h2>
<p>We are planning to remove the existing reports feature because they are not well
designed. We will re-implement existing functionality that our community finds useful,
add new types of reports (incl. nicer graphics and UI) and make it possible for the
reporting sub-system to be more easily extendable.</p>
<p>Phase out is planned to begin after 1st March 2019! Until then we are looking for your
feedback. Please comment in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/657">Issue #657</a>!</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p>These will make it easier to collect results from automated test suites into
Kiwi TCMS for later analysis. Instead of creating scripts that parse the
results and talk to our API you will only have to install an additional package
in your test environment and configure the test runner to use it! Automation
test results will then appear inside Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin">JUnit 5 plugin</a> - already in progress</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/692">TestNG plugin</a> - RFC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/693">Django plugin</a> - RFC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/694">py.test plugin</a> - RFC</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to use such functionality leave your vote inside GitHub
issues! In case you would like to write a test-runner plugin you can find the
specification
<a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/2018/11/05/test-runner-plugin-specification/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: Does Kiwi TCMS integrate with JIRA?</p>
<p>Answer: Well, it does. How exactly do you want to integrate?</p>
<p>... silence ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following dialog happens every time someone asks me about bug-tracker
integration, especially with JIRA. The thing is integration is a specified
set of behavior which may or may not be desired in a particular team. As of now
Kiwi TCMS is able to open a URL to your bug-tracker with predefined field
values, add comments to bug reports and report a simple summary of bugs
inside a TestRun.</p>
<p>We recognize this may not be enough and together with the community we
really need to define what bug tracker integration means! The broader domain
of application lifecycle management tools (of which TCMS is a sub-set) have an
integrated bug tracking system. We can add something like this and save you
the trouble of using JIRA, however many teams have already invested in
integrating their infrastructure or just like other tools. For example we love
GitHub issues and our team regularly makes public reports about issues that
we find internally!</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Redefine what bug-tracker integration means, vote in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/698">Issue #698</a></li>
<li>Goal: Bug-tracker functionality inside Kiwi TCMS, similar to
  GitHub Issues. Vote in

  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/530">Issue #530</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p>Developers have their
<a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub PR flow</a> and if they
have done the job of having unit tests then they will merge only when things
are green! This leaves additional testing efforts kind of to the side and
doesn't really help with transparency and visibility. I'm not going to mention
having an automatically deployed staging environment for every change
because very few teams actually have managed to do this effectively.</p>
<p><img src="/images/github_kiwitcms_pr_status.png" style="float:none"
     alt="Kiwi TCMS statuses on GitHub PR" title="Kiwi TCMS statuses on GitHub PR"></p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Figure out how Kiwi TCMS can integrate with GitHub flow and bridge the gap.
  Please share and <code>+1</code> your wildest ideas in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/700">Issue #700</a>.</li>
<li>Follow up: depending on the results in #700 we will follow with other goals and
  sub-tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p>Speaking of modern engineering flow is your team truly agile? When and how
do you plan your testing activities ? Before the devel sprint or afterwards?
How many testers take part in refining product backlog and working on user stories?</p>
<p>Similar to GitHub flow lots of teams and open source projects are using Trello
to effectively organize their development process. Testing should not be left
behind and Kiwi TCMS may be able to help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Figure out how Kiwi TCMS fits into the overall <code>devel-test-planning</code>
  process for agile teams and what we can do to make this easier for testers.
  Please share and <code>+1</code> your wildest ideas in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/701">Issue #701</a></li>
<li>Follow up: depending on the results in #701 we will follow with other goals and
  sub-tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p>What makes a test engineer productive when they need to assess product risk and
new features, when mapping product requirements documents (PRD) to test plans and
test cases, when collaborating on user stories and behavior specification ?
What makes developers, product owners, designers and other professionals productive
when it comes to dealing with testing ?</p>
<p>For example consider the following workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company has idea for a new product</li>
<li>In case this is a big product it may have its own mission, i.e. what kind
  of problem is it trying to solve and for which group of customers</li>
<li>Product backlog is then created which outlines features that map
  to the product mission</li>
<li>Then the team, together with test engineers perform example mapping
  and discuss and refine the initial feature requirements. User stories
  are created</li>
<li>Behavior specification may also be created</li>
<li>Test plans and test cases are the immediate product of BDD specs and
  desired user stories</li>
</ul>
<p>Later we iterate through the sprints and for each sprint something like
this happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desired product features are planned for development. They must be <em>complete</em>
  at least in terms of requirements, specs and tests</li>
<li>Devel writes code, maybe some unit tests, testers can also write automated tests
  and/or manually verify the current state of the feature being developed</li>
<li>Testing, including exploratory is performed before feature is merged</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>Devel is also part of testing, right? Product owners, UX and interaction
designers as well. Producing quality software product is a team effort!</p>
<p>In every step of the way Kiwi TCMS can provide notification wizards, guidelines
and/or documentation for best practices, facilitate tooling, e.g. to write user stories
and assess them or map out an exploratory testing session, etc. The list
of ideas is virtually endless. We can even go into deep learning, AI and
blockchain but honestly who knows how to use them in testing ?</p>
<p>Our team is not quite sure how this goal will look like 3 months from now
but we are certain that testing needs to happen first, last and all the time
during the entire software development lifecycle. By providing the necessary
functionality and tools in Kiwi TCMS we can boost engineering productivity
and steer the testing process in your organization into a better, more productive
direction which welcomes participation from all engineering groups.</p>
<p>Let's consider another point of view: testing is a creative activity
which is benefited by putting your brain into a specific state of mind!
For example Gherkin (the Given-When-Then language) has the benefit of
forcing you to think about behavior and while doing so you are vocalizing
the various roles in the system, what kind of actions are accepted and
what sort of result is expected! Many times this will help you remember or
discover missing scenarios, edge cases and raise even more questions!</p>
<p>Crazy ideas, brain dumps and <code>+1</code> as always are welcome in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/703">Issue #703</a>.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Coding alone is not fun! Here's what you can do to help us:</p>

<li>Vote with a <code>+1</code> reaction on GitHub issues (top-right corner)</li>
<li>Send us testimonials and feedback about using Kiwi TCMS.
  We will be happy to publish them on our website</li>
<li>Send us a pull request on GitHub</li>
<li><a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">Become a sponsor</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also looking to expand our core team and the list of occasional
contributors. The following are mostly organizational goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: participate in 5 conferences with a project stand</li>
<li>Goal: define how we find, recruit and onboard new team members. The
  foundation is already set in
  <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/3/kiwi-tcms-team-onboarding#testcases">TP-3</a></li>
<li>Goal: clearly mark GitHub issues which are suitable for external contributors
  which don’t want to spend lots of time learning how Kiwi TCMS works under the hood.
  We're going to tag all such issues with the
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/labels/help%20wanted">
    <img src="/images/github_helpwanted.png" style="float: none; margin:0"
         alt="GitHub help wanted" title="GitHub help wanted">
  </a> label</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development policy</h2>
<p>Our team will be working on areas related to the goals above. A <code>+1</code>
reaction on GitHub issues will help us prioritize what we work on!</p>
<p><img src="/images/github_plus_one.png" style="float:none"
     alt="GitHub +1" title="GitHub +1"></p>
<p>Bug fixes and other
issues will be occasionally slipped into the stream and pull requests from
non-team contributors will be reviewed and merged in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>There is at least 1 full day of work that goes behind the scenes when
a new version is officially released: compile changelog, build images and
upload them, create blog post and newsletter announcement, share on social
media, etc. We also deploy on our own Kiwi TCMS instance as a stop-gap
measure before making everything public!</p>
<p>New PyPI tarballs and Docker images will be released every few weeks as
we see fit, this has been our standard process. We try to align releases
with Django's release schedule and try to cut a new version when there are known
security vulnerabilities fixed. However we can't guarantee this will always
be the case!</p>
<p>If you are in a hurry and need something quickly the best option is to
send a pull request, build your own Docker image from source and
maybe consider
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">sponsoring us via Open Collective</a>!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals in our 2018
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>
(<a href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/25/mid-year-roadmap-status-report/">mid-year update here</a>).
TLDR; goals are completed at 62%. Refactoring legacy code is showing good results,
less so on the front-end side and there are items still in progress!</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> reported
a "D" rating with 600+ code smells and 600+ duplications and a 1 year estimation
to resolve these. We're now down to "C" rating with 171 smells and 203 duplications.</p>
<p>The level of technical debt has dropped from 32.5% down to 17.7% and we have removed
around 14000 lines of Python code and 8000 lines of JavaScript code without
losing significant functionality.</p>
<p>Checkout
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/trends/technical_debt">the stats</a>
for more info!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p><em>Status: almost finished</em></p>
<p>Both pylint and pylint-django have been integrated into our CI workflow. There are even
some custom built plugins that we use. The number of issues reported is down to 100
from 4000+ initially. These are predominantly <code>fixme</code> comments which are also in parts
of the code that are scheduled for removal and refactoring.</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Several views were modified to return pure JSON but we've not
done any targeted work to resolve this issue. A number of other views have been
removed in favor of using the existing JSON-RPC layer.</p>
<p>This is an internal refactoring effort which isn't very visible from the outside.
This is also one of the factors contributing to the high number of removed
source code.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Not much has been done in this area except the occasional refactoring to
JSON-RPC.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p><em>Status: complete</em></p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress, dropped</em></p>
<p>All RPC methods have been documented! The rest of the internals will be documented
as we go along.</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We still carry around jQuery, jQuery-UI and Handlebars.js. They will be
removed once the pages using them are converted to use the Patternfly widgets
library.</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>There are still over 50 HTML templates in <code>tcms/templates/</code> that need to be
refactored into Patternfly. We've been working on them one at a time and will
focus more on this effort in the next couple of months.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Some of the pages have been converted to use Patternfly. The most important pages
that still have a different look and feel are TestPlan view, TestCase view and
TestRun view. These are also the hardest to convert because they have lots of
tabs/components which pull information from various places. Our goal is to create
reusable widgets for the various components (e.g. a list of TestCases) and then
include these components into several different templates to minimize code
duplication.</p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>A number of JavaScript functions have been refactored and removed during the
past few releases but there are still thousands of lines of code left to deal with.
This effort is mostly happening in parallel with the Patternfly redesign.
We still don't have anything to test front-end JavaScript functionality!</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We are seeing a steady stream of new users registered on
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> and
there are several active contributors on GitHub. Most of our translators are
very active and keep their respective languages fresh and up to date!</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS was represented at OSCAL Tirana, DjangoCon Heidelberg, PyCon Prague,
HackConf Sofia, PiterPy St. Petersburg and OpenFest Sofia. We've also been
approved for a project stand at FOSDEM 2019 so watch this blog for more news.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I am happy to announce that <a href="/team/">our team</a> is steadily growing!
As we work through our <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>,
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/25/mid-year-roadmap-status-report/">status update here</a>, and
on-board new team members I start to feel the need for a bit more structure
and organization behind the scenes. I also wish for consistent contributions
to the project (commit early, commit often) so I can better estimate the resources
that we have!</p>
<p>I am also actively discussing Kiwi TCMS with lots of people at various conferences
and generate many ideas for the future. The latest SEETEST in Belgrade was particularly
fruitful. Some of these ideas are pulling into different directions and I need help
to keep them under control!</p>
<p>Development-wise sometimes I lose track of what's going on and who's doing what between
working on Kiwi TCMS, preparing for conferences and venues to promote the project,
doing code review of other team members, trying not to forget to check-in on
progress (especially by interns), recruiting fresh blood and thinking about
the overall future of the project. Our user base is growing and there are days
where I feel like everything is happening at once or that something
needs to be implemented ASAP (which is usually true anyway)!</p>
<p><img class="rounded" src="/images/team/rstankova.jpg"></p>
<p>Meet Rayna Stankova in the role of our team coach!
Reny is a director for Women Who Code Sofia, senior QA engineer at VMware,
mentor with CoderDojo Bulgaria and a long-time friend of mine.
Although she is an experienced QA in her own right she will be contributing
to the people side of Kiwi TCMS and less so technically!</p>
<p>Her working areas will be planning and organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>help us (re)define the project vision and goals</li>
<li>work with us on roadmaps and action plans so we can meet
  the project goals faster</li>
<li>help us (self) organize so that we are more efficient,
  including checking progress and blockers (aka enforcer) and
  meet the aforementioned consistency point</li>
<li>serve as our professional coach, motivator and somebody who will
  take care of team health (yes I really suck at motivating others)</li>
</ul>
<p>and generally serving as another very experienced member of the team!</p>
<p>We did a quick brainstorming yesterday and started to produce results
(#smileyface)! We do have a team docs space to share information
(non-public for now, will open it gradually as we grow) and came up
with the idea to use Kiwi TCMS as a check-list for our on-boarding/internship
process!</p>
<p>I don't know how it will play out but I do expect from the
team to self-improve, be inspired, become more focused and more productive!
<strong>All of this also applies to myself, even more so!</strong></p>
<h2>Existing team members progress</h2>
<p>Last year we started with 2 existing team members (Tony and myself) and 3
new interns (Ivo, Kaloyan and Tseko) who built this website!</p>
<p>Tony is the #4 contributor to Kiwi TCMS in
terms of <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/graphs/contributors">number of commits</a>
and is on track to surpass one of the original authors (before Kiwi TCMS was forked)!
He's been working mostly on internal refactoring and resolving the thousands
of pylint errors that we had (down to around 500 I think). This summer Tony and I
visited the OSCAL conference in Tirana and hosted an info booth for the project.</p>
<p>Ivo is the #5 contributor in terms of numbers of commits. He did learn very
quickly and is working on getting rid of the remaining pylint errors. His ability
to adapt and learn is quite impressive actually. Last month he co-hosted a
git workshop at HackConf, a 1000+ people IT event in Sofia.</p>
<p>Kaloyan did most of the work on our website initially (IIRC).
Now he is studying in the Netherlands
and not active on the project. We are working to reboot his on-boarding
and I'm hoping he will find the time to contribute to Kiwi TCMS regularly.</p>
<p>From the starting team only Tseko decided to move on to other ventures after
he contributed to the website.</p>
<h2>Internship program</h2>
<p>At Kiwi TCMS we have a set of training
programs that teach all the necessary technical skills before we let anyone
actively work on the project, let alone become a team member.</p>
<p>Our new interns are Denitsa Uzunova and Desislava Koleva. Both of them are
coming from Vratsa Software Community and were mentors at the recently held
CodeWeek hackathon in their home city! I wish them fast learning and good luck!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>.</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> reported
a "D" rating with a 1 year estimated effort. Now it is still on "D" rating with
a 7 months estimated effort to bring the project back in shape.
Code smells have dropped from 600+ to 418, duplications have been reduced from 600+ to 359!
At the same time technical debt ratio has been decreased from 32,5% to 21,6% and
little over 10000 lines of code have been removed from the source code.
Checkout
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/trends/technical_debt">the stats</a>
for more info!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>Both pylint and pylint-django have been integrated into our CI workflow. There are even
a few custom built plugins that we use. The number of issues reported is down to around 900
from 4000+ initially. The cleanup has been lead by <a href="https://github.com/asankov">Anton Sankov</a>
with help from <a href="https://github.com/ivo0126">Ivaylo Ivanov</a> and myself.</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Several views were probably modified to return pure JSON in the meantime but we've not
done any targeted work to resolve this issue.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Same as above, not much has been done in this area.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p><em>Status: complete</em></p>
<p>After Kiwi TCMS v4.0 the server side API has been reorganized and updated
to follow the model/method names used internally.</p>
<p>After the recent version 5.0 the client side API library has been stripped
to its most basic form so that you can work directly with the responses from
the server.</p>
<p>There is no more duplication and ambiguity in names because there isn't
a lot of code left!</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress, dropped</em></p>
<p>All RPC methods have been documented! The rest of the internals will be documented
as we go along.</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Several JavaScript libraries have been removed but we still carry around jQuery
and Handlebars.js. No work has been done to convert Kiwi TCMS to use the jQuery
version provided with Django.</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p><em>Status: minimal progress</em></p>
<p>There are still over 100 HTML templates in Kiwi TCMS. Some of the HTML templates
have been merged together, some email templates have been refactored and marked
as translatable but the majority of them have not been updated for a long time.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p><em>Status: small progress</em></p>
<p>A number of JavaScript functions have been refactored and removed during the
past few releases but there are still thousands of lines of code left to deal with.</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>We are seeing a steady stream of new users registered on
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> and
there are several active contributors (issues, translations).</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS was represented at OSCAL Tirana, DjangoCon Heidelberg and PyCon Prague!
We're planning to attend HackConf and OpenFest in Sofia by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

                on Mon 22 January 2018
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone. As you know Kiwi TCMS has been around for a while and it has
gone through some big changes in the last year! It started as an abandoned
Django 1.6 project with broken test suite and is now currently running on the
latest Django 2.0.1 with Python 3.5! It is clearly a legacy code base!</p>
<p>We, the Kiwi TCMS team, have learned a lot more about the project and this
blog post describes our roadmap for 2018 in terms of technical work and community
engagement. The general technical direction is cleaner/simpler code,
improved UI/UX and more tests!</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p>The current code is a bunch of very large modules and functions and classes
bundled together. It is also old and sometimes looks like spaghetti code.
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> gives us a "D" rating
for maintainability with a 1 year estimated effort to fix that. There are 600+
code smells and 600+ duplications detected by CodeClimate. Our goal is to get this
number down to zero!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p>pylint is the standard static analyzer for Python and currently it reports over
4000 errors and warnings when executed against Kiwi TCMS. This is a huge number and
it needs to become zero! We've also identified interesting patterns that will
make it into pylint and pylint-django plugins!</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p>The current state of affairs is a mix and match of everything. There are views that
render HTML, others which return pure JSON, other which return HTML encoded as JSON string
and probably everything in between. Views that render pages need to do just that
and views that are used with AJAX calls from the UI need to return pure JSON!
A lot of these are hiding in plain sight and will come to light when we start
overhauling the user interface.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p>There are lots of forms in Kiwi TCMS. Sometimes they are submitted by the user and
other times they are serialized and POSTed by some JavaScript code. This isn't
very easy to understand plus this entire home-grown utility code doesn't bring
anything useful to the project. All of these need to be identified and cleaned up.
JavaScript code needs to send or consume JSON, nothing else!</p>
<p>There are also lots of places where Kiwi issues GET requests with a number of
query parameters. Our goal is to minimize these and where possible have the
parameters as part of the Django urls scheme, not as query strings.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p>The current API module is a bit disorganized. API namespaces don't match the
names of the underlying DB models and the API client classes don't match any
of the other two! The way we pass parameters and what these parameters are
named should match between the client, the RPC method and the underlying model!</p>
<p>In earlier releases we've removed duplicate or similar RPC methods and we
think there are more of these that need our love.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>We've started producing documentation from doc-strings and most of the RPC
methods have such. However it is unformatted and barely readable, sometimes
even inaccurate. Previous releases made progress on this but there's a lot
more to cover.</p>
<p>All RPC methods should be documented first and then the rest of Kiwi's
internals to make development easier!</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p>There are 11 vendored-in JavaScript files that we carry around in Kiwi TCMS.
Most notable are jQuery plus a few addons and Handlebars.js. To the extent possible
our goal is to use jQuery provided by Django or installed via NPM dependencies!</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p>There are over 100 HTML templates in Kiwi TCMS. There are also email and even
JavaScript templates. For example there are <code>get_cases.html</code> and <code>get_review_cases.html</code>
which are essentially the same. This is kind of also true for templates used in
new and edit views! Such templates should be unified!</p>
<p>Those JavaScript templates need to be totally gone!</p>
<p>All templates are stuffed together in a single directory and their names
are not very predictable. They need to be split per application and follow
some kind of naming convention.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p>The UI already uses the Patternfly library for some of its widgets. Most notably
the main navigation header. Our goal is for the entire UI to be ported to Patternfly
by updating widgets HTML and CSS where needed.
This will also help clean things up a lot. At the same time we'll be rethinking how
information is organized on screen and how the person interacts with it! Usability
suggestions are very welcome!</p>
<p>This move will also help us get rid of the Handlebars dependency which is now
used for pop-up dialogs.</p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p>There's lots of JavaScript code on the front-end and honestly we don't quite know
what it does or how it is organized. There are also no tests on the front-end
whatsoever!</p>
<p>It is our goal for this to change with the intention to not overdo the JavaScript
part and keep things very minimal. At the moment we're thinking about vanilla jQuery
that will act as a proxy between the browser and the back-end!</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p>A year ago hardly anybody knew what Kiwi TCMS was, the project didn't even have
this name, there was 1 active contributor and hardly any users! Now the community
has started to slowly revitalize, we're seeing some contributions from our
junior team members (more on this in another blog post) and also seeing
folks installing and using Kiwi TCMS and reporting interesting bugs and feature
requests around it!</p>
<p>For the upcoming year our goal is to seek active engagement with other open source
projects that could make use of Kiwi TCMS and work with them. Kudos to
openSUSE for being the first
<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/95">to propose such integration</a>!
We're also planning couple of appearances at a few conferences but there's
nothing confirmed yet.</p>
<p>Every other contribution in terms of bug reports, new users and feature requests
is of course welcome but we're very conscious of the fact that there's tons
of work to be done and the team is still very small!</p>
<p>Team wise we'd like to get the existing team members up to speed and tackle
the above tasks with priority. This will also help us introduce bug fixes
and new features more quickly!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
