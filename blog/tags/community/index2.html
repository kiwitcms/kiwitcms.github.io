            <p>We are happy to announce that <a href="https://qgis.org">QGIS</a> has chosen Kiwi TCMS
for the basis of their <em>Quality Assurance methodology and infrastructure</em>
improvement program!
Kiwi TCMS will play a central role in storing test case definitions,
organizing test cycles, and assigning and tracking test executions by testers
from the QGIS community.</p>
<div class="member-bio" style="margin-top: 2vh">

    <p>
        QGIS is a free and open source geographic information system which contains
        desktop, server, web and mobile applications for various operating systems.
        It is an established project with very large and diverse community and also
        one of the very well known open source GIS systems.
    </p>
</div>

<p>The proposal
<a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/180">QEP#180</a> is the
highest voted proposal in the
<a href="http://blog.qgis.org/2020/07/10/qgis-grant-programme-2020-results/">2020 QGIS Grant Program</a>
and has been awarded a budget of 5000â‚¬!
This grant will allow the proponents to spend significantly more time setting up the
infrastructure and planning a methodology for manual testing.</p>
<h2>Scope of proposal</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/180">QEP#180</a>
aims to create the necessary infrastructure and methodology to organize and
encourage systematic testing before each QGIS release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a test management system to organize test cycles, assign and track tests execution;</li>
<li>Elaborate and document a methodology to execute testing to help testers;</li>
<li>Resurrect and move the tester plugin to QGIS repositories. Publish it in the QGIS official repository</li>
<li>Create an initial set of relevant test cases;</li>
<li>Organize and execute the initial test cases for the next releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>This effort will steer members &amp; volunteers of the QGIS community towards a more systematic
and organized testing during a feature freeze period before a release. The focus here
is on integration testing, manual &amp; semi-automated workflows for important functionality
that should never regress and is hard or impossible to cover via unit tests.</p>
<p>The proposal is lead by Alexandre Neto, Giovanni Manghi and Alexander Bruy!</p>
<p><br>
On behalf of the Kiwi TCMS community welcome aboard and happy testing!</p>

            <p>We are happy to announce that versioned releases of Kiwi TCMS container
images are now available to customers with an active
<a href="/#subscriptions">enterprise subscription</a>.</p>
<p>For a long time our release policy has been to push only <code>latest</code> version
of our upstream <code>kiwitcms/kiwi</code> containers. This upstream channel doesn't
carry version tags and receives versioned releases only when there are
backwards incompatible database migrations!
This proved challenging to administrators who don't upgrade
immediately to the latest version as soon as it comes out.</p>
<p>For example this happens in environments where admins use the upstream images
as proof of concept and later switch to a production grade installation.
Quite often they migrate to the <em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> containers during the
same time.</p>
<p>Starting today versioned releases of Kiwi TCMS (single tenant) will be available
via the <code>mrsenko/kiwitcms</code> private repository on Docker Hub.
This repository includes tagged versions of the same docker images coming from
the <code>kiwitcms/kiwi</code> channel!
Access is granted automatically to all existing enterprise subscribers!</p>

            <p>We are happy to announce that Kiwi TCMS is going to partner with
<a href="https://pionir.org/">Pionir</a> on the development of open source hardware
for testers!
Pionir is a free school focused on creating a new generation of digital leaders,
an exponential culture and solving challenges using technology. They are located
in Kikinda, Serbia.</p>
<p><img style="background-color:inherit; margin-left:0"
     src="/images/pionir_students.jpg"
     alt="Pionir students"></p>
<p>This is not our first collaboration - the students are already
aware of the Kiwi TCMS project and last year they participated in
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/08/09/kiwi-tcms-conference-presence-aw2019/">presentation &amp; workshop hosted by Alex</a>.
Zamphyr, the organization behind Pionir, is also one of the first open source projects
on our OSS program!</p>
<h2>Black boxes for black-box testing</h2>
<p>Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality
of the subject under test without peering into its internal structures or workings.
It is often performed by manipulating the possible inputs and examining the resulting
output. Experienced black-box testers often develop a hunch for where bugs my be
and it is not uncommon for them to discover some obscure problems nobody else thought
about. More often than not the basis for this is developing an understanding/expectation
how the SUT works by careful exploration during many iterations. Thus being able to
explore a SUT, observe its behavior, keep mental notes about possible relations
between input-behavior-output and analyzing what is happening under the hood becomes
an important skill for testers.</p>
<p>The idea for having something unknown to explore &amp; train your skills first comes
from <a href="http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/">James Lyndsayâ€™s Black Box Puzzles</a> and
was more recently implemented by
<a href="http://blog.brainforit.com/2017/02/06/black-boxes-for-black-box-testing/">Claudiu Draghia</a>.
Now it's our turn!</p>
<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>Pionir will be developing hardware black boxes for teaching exploratory testing in
cooperation with Kiwi TCMS. We have dedicated
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/expenses/18960">â‚¬2000 from our bounty program</a>
for students of the free school towards completing this project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of the project is to produce at least 3 boxes and reference designs that will
serve as a didactic tool for teaching, but also be free and open hardware, and as such,
available to everyone to build from source.</p>
<p>This project will be trusted to the students of the free school who will get opportunity
to take part in the challenging process of building a digital appliance,
from designing the machine logic, to develop and prototype hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project includes designing, assembling, programming, documenting and delivering this
hardware to us! Everything is expected to be open source: list of components,
assembly instructions, 3D design files, source code, documentation and instructions!
Our goal is that this will be relatively cheap and easy to build so everyone else
can build their own boxes.
During the next several months there will be new repositories created under
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms">https://github.com/kiwitcms</a> to host the various boxes.</p>
<p>The black boxes are expected to be available in October 2020 - just in time for the
upcoming conference season where members of the larger testing and open source
communities will be able to practice with them!</p>
<h2>Call for sponsors</h2>
<p>We are also calling upon teams and organizations who use Kiwi TCMS in their
testing workflows. Please consider making a one-time donation or
becoming a regular sponsor via our
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms#section-contribute">Collective</a>.
You can contribute as low as â‚¬ 1! The entire budget will be distributed to the community!</p>

  which is first to pass DoD and code review will be merged and the conflicting ones closed</li>
<li>Please comment on issues and work together with other community members to
  split the work and avoid collisions as much as possible</li>
</ul>
<h2>About issues</h2>
<p>Our team will try to clearly describe each task and what constitutes a
successfully completed task, e.g. <em>definition of done</em> (DoD). If this isn't the case
please ask questions and seek clarification about such tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only Issues under the <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/4">bounty-program milestone</a>
  <strong>AND</strong> labelled with a specific monetary amount are eligible for payout!</li>
<li>Unlabelled issues need further refinement before they can be accepted for bounties!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Payout rules</h2>
<p>Once DoD has been met and the contribution is merged you may claim the assigned bounty.
You must perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/expenses/new">Submit an expense</a> to the
  Kiwi TCMS Collective</li>
<li>All expenses submitted to the Kiwi TCMS Collective must follow the invoicing rules
  of our Fiscal Host.
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-unqsnko4Eaza3fSuVAUFqvhMwe-h1V8jhruTDBjrUY/copy">Here is an invoice template (Google Doc)</a>
  you can use. Fill-in the blue parts and leave the black parts</li>
<li>Invoice &amp; expense description contains the number of issue(s) and PR(s) for which
  bounty is claimed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identity cross validation:</strong></p>
<p>Once an expense has been submitted add a comment with your GitHub/Crowdin username
to it + open a
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/new?assignees=atodorov&amp;labels=&amp;template=claim_bounty.md&amp;title=">new issue in GitHub</a>
/new discussion in Crowdin with link to
the expense submission. This will help us cross-validate that we are talking
to the same person between platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Note on bank transfers</strong></p>
<p>A message from our <a href="https://opencollective.com/europe">Fiscal Host</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We currently prefer to do payouts using bank transfers.
We used to support PayPal but fees were way too high for the collectives.</p>
<p>About bank transfer, we do EU transfers as well as non EU (which takes more time obviously).</p>
<p>We noticed that several collectives are now using Revolut bank accounts which is the
easiest and cheapest way (itâ€™s free) to receive money anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like the fastest &amp; cheapest way to get paid is via Revolut account if you have one,
followed by standard bank transfer and PayPal account is last!</p>

            <p>Kiwi TCMS is the proud winner of a $10,000 award from Mozilla, Indeed,
Open Collective, Ford Foundation &amp; Simply Secure. Read below for the full story!</p>
<p>At the end of January Zahari alerted our team about the
<a href="https://opencollective.com/open-source-speed-dating/events/open-source-speed-dating-fosdem-2020-96f78c6c">Open Source Speed Dating FOSDEM 2020</a>
event and Alex was very swift in filing the application form. Just as we landed
in Brussels, ready to host
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/11/26/kiwi-tcms-is-going-to-fosdem-2020/">Testing and Automation devroom and the Open Source Test Management stand</a>,
we got the news - Kiwi TCMS has been selected as a participant.</p>
<p>What followed was a very hasty day of preparing a 5 min pitch and rehearsing it
as much as possible so we can be ready to present our project. Alex prepared the
pitch and made final review and polishing together with Anton.
For the record everything was written down on paper,
including important facts about the project and schedule - when and where is our slot,
how is Alex going to get there, when does he need to leave to be on time, etc.
We believe that preparation was key here and that's why our team always tries to
be prepared when we participate at events! It was as good
as it can get, no more changes!</p>
<p>On Feb 1st all hell broke loose - it was day #1 of FOSDEM,
the Testing an Automation devroom was full with amazing speakers and packed with people,
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/">watch videos here</a>,
there was barely time to eat or drink water and at 5PM Alex had to rush across town to pitch
Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<p>Then everything went like clockwork - weather was warm for the season,
Alex decided to walk from ULB to La Tricoterie, both so he doesn't get stuck in traffic but
also to regulate stress level and be clear minded for what comes next. He arrived just on
time to meet with new folks and have a glass of wine before taking his turn with the judges.</p>
<p>Open Source Speed Dating is a format where projects pitch to a team of 3 judges who then
follow up with various questions. Their goal is to assess how suitable your project is
for the money they are giving away but also how would actually receiving an award help the project.
You do get guidance how to prepare and what sort of information the judges are looking for.
However you have no idea who the other participants are and who are you competing against!
All you have is a 15 minutes slot where you have to give the best of you and hope it is
enough.</p>
<p>Afterwards we reunited together, did even more walking, played the SPACESHIP at
<em>Let Me Out</em> escape room and finished with a mandatory team dinner in the hearth of Brussels.</p>
<p>Following an internal selection process and due diligence we finally received the award.
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/transactions">$10,000 for open source</a>!</p>
<p>As a side note we also got to know who the other winners are, which can be seen from
<a href="https://opencollective.com/open-source-speed-dating/transactions">Open Source Speed Dating records</a>:
F-Droid, ossia, MNT Research GmbH and Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<h2>Weâ€™re giving all of it to our community</h2>
<p>All money from the <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/">Kiwi TCMS Collective</a>
will be going towards funding development tasks.
Like Alex told the judges - this will help us enable more hands working on Kiwi TCMS
and complete pending work faster. Stay tuned for our bounty program announcement!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
the Kiwi TCMS team sat down together last week and talked about what we feel
is important for us during the upcoming year. This blog post outlines our
roadmap for 2020!</p>
<p><img style="background-color: inherit" src="/images/roadmap2020.png" alt="roadmap image 2020"></p>
<h1>Project sustainability</h1>
<p>The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means several key areas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Team</span>
<span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Technical</span>
<span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Community</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Right now we have a core team with 6 newcomers on-boarding.
Engineering performance is all over the place with some people contributing
too much while others contributing too little. More importantly there is no
consistent pace of contributions which makes planning timely completion of
technical tasks impossible.</p>
<p>At the moment we do operate as a bunch of disconnected people who happen to
talk to each other from time to time.</p>
<p>We are going to adjust our internal processes and how we on-board new members.
In fact we did our first "scrum-like" meeting this week and agreed to change
our existing practice and strive to become better as a team!</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> to have a cohesive team at the end of the year which operates with
a predictable capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry features</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">bug-tracker integration milestone</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> all pylint issues resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> migrate all remaining legacy templates to Patternfly UI. See
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/3">patternfly-migration</a> milestone.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> where FE sends AJAX requests to BE views replace with JSON RPC API instead.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> start tackling the JavaScript mess that we have. This depends and is related
to Patternfly migration and overall refactoring.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> make it easier for downstream installations to extend and override parts
of Kiwi TCMS in order for users to adjust the system to their own needs.
The system is pretty flexible as-is but there have been requests,
both online and offline, to provide some extra features! We'll start looking
into them, likely making partial progress in the next 12 months.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success at every single conference that we've been to.
Both project and team have been well received. While we are going to continue
being part of various communities around the world we are trying to limit
extensive travel and focus on functionality and partnerships which will
increase Kiwi TCMS eco-system, make the project even more popular and
drive further adoption!</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> extended GitHub integration via
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/">kiwitcms-github-app</a> plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> release the following
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">test automation framework plugins</a>
for Kiwi TCMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/phpunit-plugin/">PHPUnit plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/pytest-plugin/">py.test plugin</a></li>
<li>TestNG plugin</li>
<li>Jenkins plugin</li>
<li>Robot framework plugin</li>
<li>Django plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/2">test-automation-plugins</a> milestone.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> work with our partners from the proprietary and open source worlds.
This is hard to quantify and lots of it doesn't actually depend on the team.
However we are continuing to talk to them regularly. Expect new feedback to
become available under GitHub Issues.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> see what we can do about testing productivity! This has always been
part of our mission but we have not been able to produce anything worth sharing.
We do have ideas in this space but we are generally looking for partnerships and collaborations.
It is very likely that there will not be very much progress on this front
because it is hard to define it properly :-(.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>At the end of the day most of these goals compliment each other and help drive all of
them to completion. Many of the still on-boarding people have expressed desire to
improve their Python &amp; Django skills. Working to resolve issues in the above specific
areas will give them this opportunity! I expect they will show good progress on their respective

            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">2019 roadmap</a>.
TL,DR: last year we've made lots of big and visible changes in Kiwi TCMS.
This year less so. Progress has been slower than before and not so much
visible. Community and team is growing. More contributors are welcome.</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p><em>Status: small progress, needs help</em></p>
<p><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> progress is:</p>
<ul>
<li>-60 code smells</li>
<li>-55 duplications</li>
<li>-50 other issues</li>
<li>4.4% technical debt improvement</li>
<li>-240 hrs remaining until issues are fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>The trend is showing less issues remaining
but it has been a slow progress. As we fix the easier items the remaining ones
become harder to deal with.</p>
<p>We've done minor work related to fixing issues reported by pylint. Around
150 of them still remain!</p>
<p>We have not done any targeted work to resolve other issues reported by Scrutinizer,
remove vendored-in JavaScript libraries, JavaScript refactoring or
classification of issues in 3rd party dependencies.</p>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: 60% done, needs help</em></p>
<p>There are 22 HTML templates remaining to be redesigned (from 59). That's mostly
due to internal cleanup and some refactoring! Test plan and Test run pages are the
two major templates that still need to be redesigned with Patternfly.</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting aka Telemetry</h2>
<p><em>Status: 60% done, in progress, behind schedule</em></p>
<p>The specs for the new <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry</a> system
have been defined after taking into account feedback on GitHub issues. Anton Sankov is
the leading developer for this feature. So far we have 4 telemetry reports merged:
testing break-down, status matrix, execution trends and flaky tests.</p>
<p>There are lots of minor issues or missing functionality in these first iterations
(compared to specification). Work continues on the other telemetry use-cases
and related items.</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p><em>Status: good, needs help</em></p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em> no change in last 6 months.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see plugins for more test automation frameworks
and/or file formats please checkout the
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automation-frameworks.html">documentation</a>
for links and more info.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: 66% complete, in progress, behind schedule</em></p>
<p>We've been making slow progress on this milestone lately. For more info
see
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1</a></p>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: done, awaiting deployment</em></p>
<p>Our team spent some time making Kiwi TCMS the first open source TCMS available
on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms">GitHub Marketplace</a>. At the end
of this year we were able to create a small application that allows further
integration and extending the testing workflow to the GitHub platform.</p>
<p>This is waiting on a few more clarifications from GitHub before we deploy but
for now it can be considered as done. Future functionality will be tracked
and developed directly at
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues">https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues</a>.</p>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress, will drop</em></p>
<p>This will be dropped from roadmap for the next year until we can get more interest
from the community.</p>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Looking for external help here. This will stay as a low priority item on our
roadmap for 2020 until we can free more resources on the team.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><em>Status: great, on track, needs work</em></p>
<p>This is our strongest area during this year. We have a strong presence in
multiple communities, our event schedule is very busy and we are gaining more
recognition every day! Core team hit several big bumps this year and is still
recovering with a few more people onboarding.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS suffers from the problem that many of our users can't be contributors
or simply don't want to!</p>
<p>In short: it is important for us to follow our mission and develop our core team
so we can deliver on promises made in our roadmap! That requires a lot of time and
effort which reduces short-term productivity.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Next month our team will be at
<a href="https://pyconbalkan.com/">PyCon Balkan, Oct 3-5</a> in Belgrade. Together with
presentation and a workshop we are going to host open source sprints!
These will be an informal gathering where participants will be able to
learn more about how open source works and go through their first
contributions. This is ideal for students and less experienced people
but we welcome everyone. There will be tasks ranging from easy to very hard!</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> 4 mentors from Kiwi TCMS and you!</p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> full day of peer programming and contributing to Kiwi TCMS</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> room will be announced on the days of the conference,
           follow <a href="https://twitter.com/KiwiTCMS">@KiwiTCMS</a> for more info</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> up your tech skills, build your GitHub profile and have fun together</p>
<h2>Translate Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>We have enabled Serbian language in our translation system. To get started
checkout our
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html#translation">translation contribution</a>
page.
Once strings are translated <code>kiwitcms-bot</code> will automatically open a pull
request with the new text.</p>
<h2>Find unused CSS classes</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>This should be relatively easy. For each class/selector defined in our CSS files
search (grep) if any of the HTML templates use it. If it is not in use then remove
it.</p>
<h2>Find unused JavaScript code</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Similar to the above. We're not 100% certain but there could be legacy JavaScript
functions which are no longer in use. Find them and remove them! At the very least
you have confirmed that all functions are in use!</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Minor severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy to moderate</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=minor&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Minor severity issues</a>.
There are many of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS lint issues (we suggest you start with this one)</li>
<li>functions longer than 25 lines of code</li>
<li>functions with bigger cognitive and cyclomatic complexity</li>
<li>modules longer than 250 LOC</li>
</ul>
<p>Try fixing a few to see how it goes and continue if you feel confident.
Not everything may be an issue so if you have any questions ask someone from our team.</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Major severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: moderate to hard</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=major&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Major severity issues</a>.
There are around 150 of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>identical and similar code blocks</li>
<li>big modules</li>
<li>big functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these require some sort of refactoring, either splitting snippets
of code into smaller pieces (functions or sub-modules) or using one function
in several places instead of 2 very similar but different functions, etc.
Ask our team members about which approach they prefer for fixing these issues
to minimize the effort spent here.</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Critical severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: hard</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=critical&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Critical severity issues</a>.
All of these are functions with high cognitive complexity and
the recommended way to deal with them is refactoring into
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/">class based views</a>.</p>
<h2>Improve pylint health</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Execute pylint against the latest sources and start fixing the issues.
Looking at <a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/579167487">pylint logs</a> the
following items are relatively easy to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything in module tcms.urls</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.telemetry.api</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.testruns.tests.test_views</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.xmlrpc.forms</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.testcases.tests.test_models</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.core.forms.fields</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.settings.common</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.settings.test</li>
<li>All <code>module-in-directory-without-init</code> errors reported for module tcms.tests.__init__</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <code>fixme</code>, <code>missing-permission-required</code> and <code>avoid-auto-field</code> errors are usually harder
to resolve and will require more work/refactoring. If you feel confident go ahead and
fix them, if not skip to the next error message.</p>
<p>We also use a custom pylint checker which reports function based views.
If you are looking for something harder to work on, then give it a try
(see 3rd pylint line in <code>Makefile</code>) and refactor some of the existing
view functions into class based views.</p>
<h2>Fix 3rd party security issues discovered by Bandit</h2>
<p>Difficulty: moderate to hard</p>
<p>Bandit is a static analysis tool similar to pylint. It focuses on discovering
issues which may lead to security vulnerabilities. We have resolved all such
issues in our own source code but we also execute Bandit against the entire
Python dependency stack. There it finds thousands of issues, so much so that
the reporter crashes.</p>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/579167486">In CI</a> there are around
130 issues reported. The best course of action here is to execute Bandit locally
against the offending library and then figure out what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>report an issue upstream</li>
<li>send a pull request upstream</li>
<li>if these are test files maybe exclude them from the package (e.g. don't ship them for production)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: inside Travis CI we have all runtime and testing dependencies which is more
than what we have inside the official Docker image for Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<h2>Work on reported issues</h2>
<p>The following issues look suitable for a sprint and don't require lots of
background knowledge. You can also find them using the
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/labels/PyConBalkan"><code>PyConBalkan</code></a> label on
GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/212">#212</a> - moderate - Convert jQ to $ -
  this is an easy search &amp; rename but will require more extensive manual testing</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/431">#431</a> - moderate to hard - Remove JavaScript fireEvent() -
  17 matches in <code>static/js/</code>. Must be replaced with direct function calls</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/652">#652</a> - easy - Removal of labels from form fields -
  all labels must be included in the HTML template and marked for translation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/681">#681</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/682">#682</a> - moderate -
  Move API modules &amp; their tests from <code>xmlrpc/api/&lt;app&gt;.py</code> to <code>&lt;app&gt;/api.py</code>. These have good test
  coverage so you have to make sure you don't break anything</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/971">#971</a> - moderate - manage.py command for changing Site URL -
  will help with automatic provisioning, e.g. Ansible. For howto see
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/custom-management-commands/">Django docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1021">#1021</a> - moderate - Update TestCase page UI to allow adding TestPlans to cases -
  use <code>TestPlan.add_case()</code> API method and refresh the widget. See how Tags and Components cards work
  in the same page</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1070">#1070</a> - moderate - manage.py command for checking email settings -
  will help with troubleshooting misconfigured email. Must raise exceptions if something fails.
  For howto see
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/custom-management-commands/">Django docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/733">#733</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/736">#736</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/738">#738</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/883">#883</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1089">#1089</a> - hard to very hard - New checkers for pylint -
  Kiwi TCMS uses customized pylint checkers to discover various conditions. We need a few more
  of them and/or update of the existing ones</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to see you in Belgrade. Until then: Happy testing!</p>

    <strong>Aneta Petkova</strong> - QA Chapter Lead at SumUp
    <em></em>

    <p>
        Aneta is a software engineer navigating the complex field of QA
        since her first "grownup" job. She's been working in the area of
        test automation for web applications using different programming languages and tools.

        Her mission is to inspire people to think about quality from the
        very inception of ideas and to blur the line between developers and
        QA specialists.

<h2>What is your professional background</h2>
<p>I have an engineering degree in computer science and I've spend the last 8 years in Quality Assurance.
Java, TestNG and UI automation with Selenium WebDriver are my strongest technical skills but
I use different programming languages and tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe languages and tools should only support an engineer and never define them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently I am the QA Chapter Lead at <a href="https://sumup.com/">SumUp</a>,
where I can work towards achieving my goals in an amazing team of people that do what they love.</p>
<h2>When did you use open source for the first time</h2>
<p>The first time I remember was in 2011, but I've probably used it before and just didn't pay attention.
To me it seemed the same as proprietary, and I guess that means it was good.</p>
<h2>Describe your contributions to the project</h2>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/">kiwitcms-junit-plugin</a>.
This is a native Java library which you can install via Maven Central. It
will discover your automated test suite and publish test execution results in
Kiwi TCMS. This plugin is very simple and requires only minimal configuration
before it is ready to work.
Check-out the example in <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/25/">TP-25</a>!</p>
<p><em>editor comment:</em> Aneta and Ivo (Kiwi TCMS) hosted the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5sp0e7LsDc">"Git crash course" workshop at HackConf 2018</a>.
Kiwi TCMS will be hosting 2 workshops this year so stay tuned!</p>
<h2>Why did you decide to contribute to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>I had recently switched Java for Ruby and I was feeling nostalgic.
Also, I had spent my entire career so far in QA and I wanted to slip on
the developer shoes for at least a little bit.</p>
<h2>Was there something which was hard for you during the contribution process</h2>
<p>I'm used to working in a team and when I started working on this project
I was the only active Java developer. Luckily for me, I live in the time of StackOverflow,
so I managed to get most of my questions answered by strangers on the Internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned tons of stuff, but mostly I learned I can build software, not just test it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Which is the best part of contributing to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Doing something that has the potential to help others and that could be improved upon.</p>
<h2>What is next for you in professional and open source plan</h2>
<p>My current focus is moving slightly into DevOps direction and I am really overwhelmed
by the amount of things to learn. I feel there is so much I want to experiment with.
I am not really planning anything related to open source - it has never been a goal for me -
but when I come across a project I feel strongly about, I'd probably be tempted to contribute.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Aneta! Happy testing!</em></p>

    <strong>PrimoÅ¾ Klemen</strong> -
    <em>QA tester, full time dad, Manchester United F.C. supporter</em>

    <p>
        PrimoÅ¾ is an early adopter and our Slovenian translator. He's been actively engaging
        in GitHub issues, posted pull requests for improving documentation and follows us on
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kiwi-tcms">StackOverflow</a> as well.

<h2>What is your professional background</h2>
<p>I've started working in IT as tech support for the 2nd largest Slovenian ISP at the time.
Then I've been at leading software provider for fintech in the Balkans region in the same
role and gradually transitioned into QA role. Currently, I'm working as a QA tester for
<a href="http://better.care">Better (by Marand)</a> and ensure, with help of my colleagues of course,
proper quality of administration application for health care sector.</p>
<h2>When did you use open source for the first time</h2>
<p>If I recall correctly that would be some 14 years ago when I ditched dreaded
Internet Explorer in favor of Mozilla Firefox browser. The whole Internet got better in
a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2>What are your contributions to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>I mainly contribute via translating the application into my native language, Slovenian.
Currently there are
<a href="https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms">7 languages available</a> for Kiwi TCMS so you are
more than welcome to join and add another one.
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html#translation">Translating via Crowdin</a>
is very simple and requires no additional technical skills. I've also dabbled into project
documentation and proposed a few updates to it. I'm also the culprit for some
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/Prome88">32 issues</a> and counting,
the majority of them being proposals for future application enhancements and few UX/UI bugs
(dÃ©formation professionnelle :-)).</p>
<h2>Why did you decide to contribute to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The guys and gals from the Kiwi TCMS team provided us with an application which solved
our pain about building, maintaining and running manual regression tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They did all of that for free in their spare time! So I've decided to give something back to
the whole community. This was indeed my first
contribution to the open source world but not the last. Since then I've also
contributed to other projects which I use on a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In hindsight, Kiwi TCMS converted me from an open source user to open source contributor!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Was there something which was hard for you during the contribution process</h2>
<p>Contributing to the project, as a non-developer, is very easy and intuitive by
either opening issues on GitHub or translating via Crowdin or even committing
updated documentation to git repository through GitHub Desktop client.
All of the aforementioned was new to me and I've learned in depth how to use
these tools. I've also had the pleasure to familiarize myself with project documentation
- Sphinx and reStructuredText are my two new best friends.</p>
<h2>Which is the best part of contributing to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Being able to actively improve an application that we use on a daily basis in our
development process. Getting to know more people from all around the globe and see their
insights about software quality assurance thus learning something new every day.</p>
<h2>What is next for you in professional and open source plan</h2>
<p>Professionally I'm 100% committed to <a href="http://better.care">Better (by Marand)</a> and helping us achieve
the best standard of quality for health care applications which also incorporates
using the knowledge gathered by following and/or contributing to open source.
I'm going to continue contributing to Kiwi TCMS and
Captura and if time allows maybe involve myself with some other interesting projects.</p>

                on Fri 28 June 2019
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">2019 mission and roadmap</a>.
TL,DR: Kiwi TCMS has made progress since January, it's been tough and may not have been
very visible. I feel like we've been behind schedule till now! The greatest
positive thing has been community and team development!</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p><em>Status: minimal progress, needs help</em></p>
<p><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> progress is:</p>
<ul>
<li>-30 code smells</li>
<li>-40 duplications</li>
<li>-30 other issues</li>
<li>4% technical debt improvement</li>
<li>-200 hrs remaining until issues are fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>This is mostly the result of code reviews and minor fixes, not targeted work.</p>
<p>We have not done any targeted work to resolve other issues reported by Scrutinizer,
Pylint, remove vendored-in JavaScript libraries, JavaScript refactoring or
classification of issues in 3rd party dependencies.</p>
<p>There are new people onboarding in the team right now and our plan is for
them to start grinding at these issues very soon!</p>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: 50% done, needs help</em></p>
<p>There are 27 HTML templates remaining to be redesigned (from 59). That's mostly
due to internal cleanup than targeted refactoring. More work on this item
will probably follow towards the end of the year after we get more priority items out of
the way and get more of the new team members rolling!</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting aka Telemetry</h2>
<p><em>Status: in progress, a bit behind schedule</em></p>
<p>The specs for the new <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry</a> system
have been defined after taking into account feedback on GitHub issues. Anton Sankov is
the leading developer for this feature. So far we have 2 telemetry reports merged:
testing break-down and status matrix. The next one will be execution trends.</p>
<p>There are lots of minor issues or missing functionality in these first iterations
(compared to specification). Our plan is to have the major use-cases satisfied first
and then work to refine all of the existing telemetry pages.</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p><em>Status: good, needs help</em></p>
<p>Until now we have released TAP, junit.xml and native JUnit 5 plugins. There's also
a PHPUnit plugin which is more or less complete but unreleased yet. Both JUnit 5
and PHPUnit plugins are developed by external contributors!</p>
<p>We often get asked for plugins for languages and frameworks we don't use or don't
even know! Given that our expertise is mostly in Python we will gladly accept your
pull requests if you decide to maintain or contribute to one of the plugins. This
will also help us get insight into what automation frameworks people are using
and how exactly you structure a test automation workflow around Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<p>Checkout the
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html">documentation</a> for links
and more info.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Last week, right after OpenExpo, we did a check-up session and this was one of the
areas identified with zero amount of progress. I have a strong preference to work
on this feature myself but have not been able to due to various other items that
need my attention.</p>
<p>The short version is that I'd prefer to remove all issue tracker specific code
and allow the tester to add arbitrary URLs to link to existing bugs. How to do
integration (even as simple as publishing a comment in the bug tracker) over
a generic interface still eludes me. In the next few weeks I will kick-off this
topic with a separate blog post/issue for everyone to comment on.</p>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Our team spent some time making Kiwi TCMS the first open source TCMS available
on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms">GitHub Marketplace</a>. We will
continue this integration effort and flow integration will emerge from that.
There's also many things that need to be done to satisfy GitHub's .</p>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Our mission is to transform testing in your organization by providing
the tools for that via Kiwi TCMS. It is astonishing that so far nobody has provided
any kind of feedback in <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/703">Issue #703</a>
wrt improving productivity in their teams!</p>
<p>We have some ideas which have been blocked by lack of resources on the team and
refactoring tasks. Because we've adopted this as our mission this is an important
item for us and we'll continue working on it as resources allow.
Progress is to be expected towards the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><em>Status: great, on track, needs work</em></p>
<p>This is our strongest area during the year so far. We have a strong presence in
several communities, our event schedule is busy enough and we are gaining more
recognition every day!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted project stand at 3/5 conferences with 2 more on-track</li>
<li>Won the OpenAward for <a href="2019-06-24-openawards-winner.markdown">Best Tech Community</a></li>
<li>Hosted several presentations and workshops with few more on track</li>
<li>Found new talent to join the core team: 2 just ready to start contributing, 5 more in training</li>
<li>1 more senior engineer as a mentor. We also have a few independent wanna-be contributors
  and will be hosting qualification interviews for marketing assistant very soon</li>
<li>There are contributions and pull requests coming from users of Kiwi TCMS as well.
  We'd like to see more of course.</li>
<li>There are a couple of open source projects and companies using Kiwi TCMS who
  are friendly towards the project. We are working with them to get a public
  endorsement on the website and engage in more technical work together. Of course
  everyone has limited resources and is very busy :-(</li>
<li>Sponsors on <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms#contributors">OpenCollect</a> are just
  a few but we didn't have any previously so this is a good sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the moment to mention that not all is honey and roses in open source land.
Kiwi TCMS suffers from the problem that many of our users can't be contributors
or simply don't want to!</p>
<p>Manual testers can't program. This is a fact and a good sized chunk of our user base
actually performs manual testing. Those that can write automation and probably
code decently well may not be familiar with Python and Django. At least in Bulgaria
these two aren't very popular, definitely not among testers. That is to say this part
of the user-base simply doesn't have the necessary skills to contribute and the majority
of what we need is code contribution!</p>
<p>Another (fairly big IMO) group of users are coming from proprietary companies who
view open source and Kiwi TCMS as a zero cost option. Something that they take free
of charge and use it without ever contributing back. They don't understand nor really
care about the open source culture.</p>
<p>To make things worse we receive requests every single day via
our private email addresses or questions via IM despite our website clearly stating
community engagement rules. On a few occasions we have received very rude comments
of the sort "our company demands you fix this", "is this going to be ready this year"
(context implying entitlement), etc. To make things more ridiculous we've even received
support requests (via contact form) from companies and start-up
who get their return address wrong so we can't get in touch directly!</p>
<p>In short: don't demand anything from us unless you are ready to pay for it, work for it
yourself or propose a mutually beneficial scenario. We do try to keep the community
happy but more importantly follow our mission and develop our core team!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p>On Tuesday I hosted my pylint workshop during the regular
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/295673718035353/">Django Bulgaria meetup</a>.
This edition was the first which was practice based.</p>
<p>Attendance numbers were low but participation was very good. We managed to
create 4 new checkers for Kiwi TCMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/949">PR #949 - AutoField checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/950">PR #950 - OneToOneField checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/951">PR #951 - discover directories without __init__.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/952">PR #952 - empty class checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/955">PR #955 - function based view checker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to all contributors. These new checkers have discovered quite a
few new issues with Kiwi TCMS so this is an area which our team is going to improve.</p>
<p>Those who missed the workshop will be able to catch up one of the next editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>26-29 August, GUADEC, Thessaloniki - TBC (presentation)</li>
<li>end of September, Python meetup, Zagreb - TBA</li>
<li>03-05 October, PyCon Balkan, Belgrade - TBC</li>
<li>11-13 October, HackConf, Sofia</li>
<li>15-17 October, TestCon Europe, Vilnius - TBC (backup presentation)</li>
