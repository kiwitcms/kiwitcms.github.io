            <p>Kiwi TCMS is the proud winner of a $10,000 award from Mozilla, Indeed,
Open Collective, Ford Foundation &amp; Simply Secure. Read below for the full story!</p>
<p>At the end of January Zahari alerted our team about the
<a href="https://opencollective.com/open-source-speed-dating/events/open-source-speed-dating-fosdem-2020-96f78c6c">Open Source Speed Dating FOSDEM 2020</a>
event and Alex was very swift in filing the application form. Just as we landed
in Brussels, ready to host
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/11/26/kiwi-tcms-is-going-to-fosdem-2020/">Testing and Automation devroom and the Open Source Test Management stand</a>,
we got the news - Kiwi TCMS has been selected as a participant.</p>
<p>What followed was a very hasty day of preparing a 5 min pitch and rehearsing it
as much as possible so we can be ready to present our project. Alex prepared the
pitch and made final review and polishing together with Anton.
For the record everything was written down on paper,
including important facts about the project and schedule - when and where is our slot,
how is Alex going to get there, when does he need to leave to be on time, etc.
We believe that preparation was key here and that's why our team always tries to
be prepared when we participate at events! It was as good
as it can get, no more changes!</p>
<p>On Feb 1st all hell broke loose - it was day #1 of FOSDEM,
the Testing an Automation devroom was full with amazing speakers and packed with people,
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/">watch videos here</a>,
there was barely time to eat or drink water and at 5PM Alex had to rush across town to pitch
Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<p>Then everything went like clockwork - weather was warm for the season,
Alex decided to walk from ULB to La Tricoterie, both so he doesn't get stuck in traffic but
also to regulate stress level and be clear minded for what comes next. He arrived just on
time to meet with new folks and have a glass of wine before taking his turn with the judges.</p>
<p>Open Source Speed Dating is a format where projects pitch to a team of 3 judges who then
follow up with various questions. Their goal is to assess how suitable your project is
for the money they are giving away but also how would actually receiving an award help the project.
You do get guidance how to prepare and what sort of information the judges are looking for.
However you have no idea who the other participants are and who are you competing against!
All you have is a 15 minutes slot where you have to give the best of you and hope it is
enough.</p>
<p>Afterwards we reunited together, did even more walking, played the SPACESHIP at
<em>Let Me Out</em> escape room and finished with a mandatory team dinner in the hearth of Brussels.</p>
<p>Following an internal selection process and due diligence we finally received the award.
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/transactions">$10,000 for open source</a>!</p>
<p>As a side note we also got to know who the other winners are, which can be seen from
<a href="https://opencollective.com/open-source-speed-dating/transactions">Open Source Speed Dating records</a>:
F-Droid, ossia, MNT Research GmbH and Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<h2>We’re giving all of it to our community</h2>
<p>All money from the <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/">Kiwi TCMS Collective</a>
will be going towards funding development tasks.
Like Alex told the judges - this will help us enable more hands working on Kiwi TCMS
and complete pending work faster. Stay tuned for our bounty program announcement!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="article">
            <p>Hello testers,
the Kiwi TCMS team sat down together last week and talked about what we feel
is important for us during the upcoming year. This blog post outlines our
roadmap for 2020!</p>
<p><img style="background-color: inherit" src="/images/roadmap2020.png" alt="roadmap image 2020"></p>
<h1>Project sustainability</h1>
<p>The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means several key areas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1) Team
2) Technical
3) Community
</pre></div>


<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Right now we have a core team with 6 newcomers on-boarding.
Engineering performance is all over the place with some people contributing
too much while others contributing too little. More importantly there is no
consistent pace of contributions which makes planning timely completion of
technical tasks impossible.</p>
<p>At the moment we do operate as a bunch of disconnected people who happen to
talk to each other from time to time.</p>
<p>We are going to adjust our internal processes and how we on-board new members.
In fact we did our first "scrum-like" meeting this week and agreed to change
our existing practice and strive to become better as a team!</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> to have a cohesive team at the end of the year which operates with
a predictable capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry features</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">bug-tracker integration milestone</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> all pylint issues resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> migrate all remaining legacy templates to Patternfly UI. See
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/3">patternfly-migration</a> milestone.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> where FE sends AJAX requests to BE views replace with JSON RPC API instead.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> start tackling the JavaScript mess that we have. This depends and is related
to Patternfly migration and overall refactoring.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> make it easier for downstream installations to extend and override parts
of Kiwi TCMS in order for users to adjust the system to their own needs.
The system is pretty flexible as-is but there have been requests,
both online and offline, to provide some extra features! We'll start looking
into them, likely making partial progress in the next 12 months.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success at every single conference that we've been to.
Both project and team have been well received. While we are going to continue
being part of various communities around the world we are trying to limit
extensive travel and focus on functionality and partnerships which will
increase Kiwi TCMS eco-system, make the project even more popular and
drive further adoption!</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> extended GitHub integration via
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/">kiwitcms-github-app</a> plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> release the following
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">test automation framework plugins</a>
for Kiwi TCMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/phpunit-plugin/">PHPUnit plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/pytest-plugin/">py.test plugin</a></li>
<li>TestNG plugin</li>
<li>Jenkins plugin</li>
<li>Robot framework plugin</li>
<li>Django plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/2">test-automation-plugins</a> milestone.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> work with our partners from the proprietary and open source worlds.
This is hard to quantify and lots of it doesn't actually depend on the team.
However we are continuing to talk to them regularly. Expect new feedback to
become available under GitHub Issues.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> see what we can do about testing productivity! This has always been
part of our mission but we have not been able to produce anything worth sharing.
We do have ideas in this space but we are generally looking for partnerships and collaborations.
It is very likely that there will not be very much progress on this front
because it is hard to define it properly :-(.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>At the end of the day most of these goals compliment each other and help drive all of
them to completion. Many of the still on-boarding people have expressed desire to
improve their Python &amp; Django skills. Working to resolve issues in the above specific
areas will give them this opportunity! I expect they will show good progress on their respective
tasks so we can write more about them on this blog.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="article">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">2019 roadmap</a>.
TL,DR: last year we've made lots of big and visible changes in Kiwi TCMS.
This year less so. Progress has been slower than before and not so much
visible. Community and team is growing. More contributors are welcome.</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p><em>Status: small progress, needs help</em></p>
<p><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> progress is:</p>
<ul>
<li>-60 code smells</li>
<li>-55 duplications</li>
<li>-50 other issues</li>
<li>4.4% technical debt improvement</li>
<li>-240 hrs remaining until issues are fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>The trend is showing less issues remaining
but it has been a slow progress. As we fix the easier items the remaining ones
become harder to deal with.</p>
<p>We've done minor work related to fixing issues reported by pylint. Around
150 of them still remain!</p>
<p>We have not done any targeted work to resolve other issues reported by Scrutinizer,
remove vendored-in JavaScript libraries, JavaScript refactoring or
classification of issues in 3rd party dependencies.</p>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: 60% done, needs help</em></p>
<p>There are 22 HTML templates remaining to be redesigned (from 59). That's mostly
due to internal cleanup and some refactoring! Test plan and Test run pages are the
two major templates that still need to be redesigned with Patternfly.</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting aka Telemetry</h2>
<p><em>Status: 60% done, in progress, behind schedule</em></p>
<p>The specs for the new <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry</a> system
have been defined after taking into account feedback on GitHub issues. Anton Sankov is
the leading developer for this feature. So far we have 4 telemetry reports merged:
testing break-down, status matrix, execution trends and flaky tests.</p>
<p>There are lots of minor issues or missing functionality in these first iterations
(compared to specification). Work continues on the other telemetry use-cases
and related items.</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p><em>Status: good, needs help</em></p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em> no change in last 6 months.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see plugins for more test automation frameworks
and/or file formats please checkout the
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automation-frameworks.html">documentation</a>
for links and more info.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: 66% complete, in progress, behind schedule</em></p>
<p>We've been making slow progress on this milestone lately. For more info
see
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1</a></p>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: done, awaiting deployment</em></p>
<p>Our team spent some time making Kiwi TCMS the first open source TCMS available
on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms">GitHub Marketplace</a>. At the end
of this year we were able to create a small application that allows further
integration and extending the testing workflow to the GitHub platform.</p>
<p>This is waiting on a few more clarifications from GitHub before we deploy but
for now it can be considered as done. Future functionality will be tracked
and developed directly at
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues">https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues</a>.</p>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress, will drop</em></p>
<p>This will be dropped from roadmap for the next year until we can get more interest
from the community.</p>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Looking for external help here. This will stay as a low priority item on our
roadmap for 2020 until we can free more resources on the team.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><em>Status: great, on track, needs work</em></p>
<p>This is our strongest area during this year. We have a strong presence in
multiple communities, our event schedule is very busy and we are gaining more
recognition every day! Core team hit several big bumps this year and is still
recovering with a few more people onboarding.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS suffers from the problem that many of our users can't be contributors
or simply don't want to!</p>
<p>In short: it is important for us to follow our mission and develop our core team
so we can deliver on promises made in our roadmap! That requires a lot of time and
effort which reduces short-term productivity.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p>Next month our team will be at
<a href="https://pyconbalkan.com/">PyCon Balkan, Oct 3-5</a> in Belgrade. Together with
presentation and a workshop we are going to host open source sprints!
These will be an informal gathering where participants will be able to
learn more about how open source works and go through their first
contributions. This is ideal for students and less experienced people
but we welcome everyone. There will be tasks ranging from easy to very hard!</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> 4 mentors from Kiwi TCMS and you!</p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> full day of peer programming and contributing to Kiwi TCMS</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> room will be announced on the days of the conference,
           follow <a href="https://twitter.com/KiwiTCMS">@KiwiTCMS</a> for more info</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> up your tech skills, build your GitHub profile and have fun together</p>
<h2>Translate Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>We have enabled Serbian language in our translation system. To get started
checkout our
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html#translation">translation contribution</a>
page.
Once strings are translated <code>kiwitcms-bot</code> will automatically open a pull
request with the new text.</p>
<h2>Find unused CSS classes</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>This should be relatively easy. For each class/selector defined in our CSS files
search (grep) if any of the HTML templates use it. If it is not in use then remove
it.</p>
<h2>Find unused JavaScript code</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Similar to the above. We're not 100% certain but there could be legacy JavaScript
functions which are no longer in use. Find them and remove them! At the very least
you have confirmed that all functions are in use!</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Minor severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy to moderate</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=minor&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Minor severity issues</a>.
There are many of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS lint issues (we suggest you start with this one)</li>
<li>functions longer than 25 lines of code</li>
<li>functions with bigger cognitive and cyclomatic complexity</li>
<li>modules longer than 250 LOC</li>
</ul>
<p>Try fixing a few to see how it goes and continue if you feel confident.
Not everything may be an issue so if you have any questions ask someone from our team.</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Major severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: moderate to hard</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=major&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Major severity issues</a>.
There are around 150 of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>identical and similar code blocks</li>
<li>big modules</li>
<li>big functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these require some sort of refactoring, either splitting snippets
of code into smaller pieces (functions or sub-modules) or using one function
in several places instead of 2 very similar but different functions, etc.
Ask our team members about which approach they prefer for fixing these issues
to minimize the effort spent here.</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Critical severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: hard</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=critical&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Critical severity issues</a>.
All of these are functions with high cognitive complexity and
the recommended way to deal with them is refactoring into
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/">class based views</a>.</p>
<h2>Improve pylint health</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Execute pylint against the latest sources and start fixing the issues.
Looking at <a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/579167487">pylint logs</a> the
following items are relatively easy to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything in module tcms.urls</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.telemetry.api</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.testruns.tests.test_views</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.xmlrpc.forms</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.testcases.tests.test_models</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.core.forms.fields</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.settings.common</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.settings.test</li>
<li>All <code>module-in-directory-without-init</code> errors reported for module tcms.tests.__init__</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <code>fixme</code>, <code>missing-permission-required</code> and <code>avoid-auto-field</code> errors are usually harder
to resolve and will require more work/refactoring. If you feel confident go ahead and
fix them, if not skip to the next error message.</p>
<p>We also use a custom pylint checker which reports function based views.
If you are looking for something harder to work on, then give it a try
(see 3rd pylint line in <code>Makefile</code>) and refactor some of the existing
view functions into class based views.</p>
<h2>Fix 3rd party security issues discovered by Bandit</h2>
<p>Difficulty: moderate to hard</p>
<p>Bandit is a static analysis tool similar to pylint. It focuses on discovering
issues which may lead to security vulnerabilities. We have resolved all such
issues in our own source code but we also execute Bandit against the entire
Python dependency stack. There it finds thousands of issues, so much so that
the reporter crashes.</p>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/579167486">In CI</a> there are around
130 issues reported. The best course of action here is to execute Bandit locally
against the offending library and then figure out what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>report an issue upstream</li>
<li>send a pull request upstream</li>
<li>if these are test files maybe exclude them from the package (e.g. don't ship them for production)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: inside Travis CI we have all runtime and testing dependencies which is more
than what we have inside the official Docker image for Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<h2>Work on reported issues</h2>
<p>The following issues look suitable for a sprint and don't require lots of
background knowledge. You can also find them using the
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/labels/PyConBalkan"><code>PyConBalkan</code></a> label on
GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/212">#212</a> - moderate - Convert jQ to $ -
  this is an easy search &amp; rename but will require more extensive manual testing</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/431">#431</a> - moderate to hard - Remove JavaScript fireEvent() -
  17 matches in <code>static/js/</code>. Must be replaced with direct function calls</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/652">#652</a> - easy - Removal of labels from form fields -
  all labels must be included in the HTML template and marked for translation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/681">#681</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/682">#682</a> - moderate -
  Move API modules &amp; their tests from <code>xmlrpc/api/&lt;app&gt;.py</code> to <code>&lt;app&gt;/api.py</code>. These have good test
  coverage so you have to make sure you don't break anything</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/971">#971</a> - moderate - manage.py command for changing Site URL -
  will help with automatic provisioning, e.g. Ansible. For howto see
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/custom-management-commands/">Django docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1021">#1021</a> - moderate - Update TestCase page UI to allow adding TestPlans to cases -
  use <code>TestPlan.add_case()</code> API method and refresh the widget. See how Tags and Components cards work
  in the same page</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1070">#1070</a> - moderate - manage.py command for checking email settings -
  will help with troubleshooting misconfigured email. Must raise exceptions if something fails.
  For howto see
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/custom-management-commands/">Django docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/733">#733</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/736">#736</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/738">#738</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/883">#883</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1089">#1089</a> - hard to very hard - New checkers for pylint -
  Kiwi TCMS uses customized pylint checkers to discover various conditions. We need a few more
  of them and/or update of the existing ones</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to see you in Belgrade. Until then: Happy testing!</p>

    <strong>Aneta Petkova</strong> - QA Chapter Lead at SumUp
    <em></em>

    <p>
        Aneta is a software engineer navigating the complex field of QA
        since her first "grownup" job. She's been working in the area of
        test automation for web applications using different programming languages and tools.

        Her mission is to inspire people to think about quality from the
        very inception of ideas and to blur the line between developers and
        QA specialists.

<h2>What is your professional background</h2>
<p>I have an engineering degree in computer science and I've spend the last 8 years in Quality Assurance.
Java, TestNG and UI automation with Selenium WebDriver are my strongest technical skills but
I use different programming languages and tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe languages and tools should only support an engineer and never define them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently I am the QA Chapter Lead at <a href="https://sumup.com/">SumUp</a>,
where I can work towards achieving my goals in an amazing team of people that do what they love.</p>
<h2>When did you use open source for the first time</h2>
<p>The first time I remember was in 2011, but I've probably used it before and just didn't pay attention.
To me it seemed the same as proprietary, and I guess that means it was good.</p>
<h2>Describe your contributions to the project</h2>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/">kiwitcms-junit-plugin</a>.
This is a native Java library which you can install via Maven Central. It
will discover your automated test suite and publish test execution results in
Kiwi TCMS. This plugin is very simple and requires only minimal configuration
before it is ready to work.
Check-out the example in <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/25/">TP-25</a>!</p>
<p><em>editor comment:</em> Aneta and Ivo (Kiwi TCMS) hosted the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5sp0e7LsDc">"Git crash course" workshop at HackConf 2018</a>.
Kiwi TCMS will be hosting 2 workshops this year so stay tuned!</p>
<h2>Why did you decide to contribute to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>I had recently switched Java for Ruby and I was feeling nostalgic.
Also, I had spent my entire career so far in QA and I wanted to slip on
the developer shoes for at least a little bit.</p>
<h2>Was there something which was hard for you during the contribution process</h2>
<p>I'm used to working in a team and when I started working on this project
I was the only active Java developer. Luckily for me, I live in the time of StackOverflow,
so I managed to get most of my questions answered by strangers on the Internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned tons of stuff, but mostly I learned I can build software, not just test it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Which is the best part of contributing to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Doing something that has the potential to help others and that could be improved upon.</p>
<h2>What is next for you in professional and open source plan</h2>
<p>My current focus is moving slightly into DevOps direction and I am really overwhelmed
by the amount of things to learn. I feel there is so much I want to experiment with.
I am not really planning anything related to open source - it has never been a goal for me -
but when I come across a project I feel strongly about, I'd probably be tempted to contribute.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Aneta! Happy testing!</em></p>

<h2>What is your professional background</h2>
<p>I've started working in IT as tech support for the 2nd largest Slovenian ISP at the time.
Then I've been at leading software provider for fintech in the Balkans region in the same
role and gradually transitioned into QA role. Currently, I'm working as a QA tester for
<a href="http://better.care">Better (by Marand)</a> and ensure, with help of my colleagues of course,
proper quality of administration application for health care sector.</p>
<h2>When did you use open source for the first time</h2>
<p>If I recall correctly that would be some 14 years ago when I ditched dreaded
Internet Explorer in favor of Mozilla Firefox browser. The whole Internet got better in
a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2>What are your contributions to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>I mainly contribute via translating the application into my native language, Slovenian.
Currently there are
<a href="https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms">7 languages available</a> for Kiwi TCMS so you are
more than welcome to join and add another one.
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html#translation">Translating via Crowdin</a>
is very simple and requires no additional technical skills. I've also dabbled into project
documentation and proposed a few updates to it. I'm also the culprit for some
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/Prome88">32 issues</a> and counting,
the majority of them being proposals for future application enhancements and few UX/UI bugs
(déformation professionnelle :-)).</p>
<h2>Why did you decide to contribute to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The guys and gals from the Kiwi TCMS team provided us with an application which solved
our pain about building, maintaining and running manual regression tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They did all of that for free in their spare time! So I've decided to give something back to
the whole community. This was indeed my first
contribution to the open source world but not the last. Since then I've also
contributed to other projects which I use on a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In hindsight, Kiwi TCMS converted me from an open source user to open source contributor!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Was there something which was hard for you during the contribution process</h2>
<p>Contributing to the project, as a non-developer, is very easy and intuitive by
either opening issues on GitHub or translating via Crowdin or even committing
updated documentation to git repository through GitHub Desktop client.
All of the aforementioned was new to me and I've learned in depth how to use
these tools. I've also had the pleasure to familiarize myself with project documentation
- Sphinx and reStructuredText are my two new best friends.</p>
<h2>Which is the best part of contributing to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Being able to actively improve an application that we use on a daily basis in our
development process. Getting to know more people from all around the globe and see their
insights about software quality assurance thus learning something new every day.</p>
<h2>What is next for you in professional and open source plan</h2>
<p>Professionally I'm 100% committed to <a href="http://better.care">Better (by Marand)</a> and helping us achieve
the best standard of quality for health care applications which also incorporates
using the knowledge gathered by following and/or contributing to open source.
I'm going to continue contributing to Kiwi TCMS and
Captura and if time allows maybe involve myself with some other interesting projects.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Primož! Happy testing!</em></p>

            </p>

        <div class="article">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">2019 mission and roadmap</a>.
TL,DR: Kiwi TCMS has made progress since January, it's been tough and may not have been
very visible. I feel like we've been behind schedule till now! The greatest
positive thing has been community and team development!</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p><em>Status: minimal progress, needs help</em></p>
<p><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> progress is:</p>
<ul>
<li>-30 code smells</li>
<li>-40 duplications</li>
<li>-30 other issues</li>
<li>4% technical debt improvement</li>
<li>-200 hrs remaining until issues are fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>This is mostly the result of code reviews and minor fixes, not targeted work.</p>
<p>We have not done any targeted work to resolve other issues reported by Scrutinizer,
Pylint, remove vendored-in JavaScript libraries, JavaScript refactoring or
classification of issues in 3rd party dependencies.</p>
<p>There are new people onboarding in the team right now and our plan is for
them to start grinding at these issues very soon!</p>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: 50% done, needs help</em></p>
<p>There are 27 HTML templates remaining to be redesigned (from 59). That's mostly
due to internal cleanup than targeted refactoring. More work on this item
will probably follow towards the end of the year after we get more priority items out of
the way and get more of the new team members rolling!</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting aka Telemetry</h2>
<p><em>Status: in progress, a bit behind schedule</em></p>
<p>The specs for the new <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry</a> system
have been defined after taking into account feedback on GitHub issues. Anton Sankov is
the leading developer for this feature. So far we have 2 telemetry reports merged:
testing break-down and status matrix. The next one will be execution trends.</p>
<p>There are lots of minor issues or missing functionality in these first iterations
(compared to specification). Our plan is to have the major use-cases satisfied first
and then work to refine all of the existing telemetry pages.</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p><em>Status: good, needs help</em></p>
<p>Until now we have released TAP, junit.xml and native JUnit 5 plugins. There's also
a PHPUnit plugin which is more or less complete but unreleased yet. Both JUnit 5
and PHPUnit plugins are developed by external contributors!</p>
<p>We often get asked for plugins for languages and frameworks we don't use or don't
even know! Given that our expertise is mostly in Python we will gladly accept your
pull requests if you decide to maintain or contribute to one of the plugins. This
will also help us get insight into what automation frameworks people are using
and how exactly you structure a test automation workflow around Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<p>Checkout the
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html">documentation</a> for links
and more info.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Last week, right after OpenExpo, we did a check-up session and this was one of the
areas identified with zero amount of progress. I have a strong preference to work
on this feature myself but have not been able to due to various other items that
need my attention.</p>
<p>The short version is that I'd prefer to remove all issue tracker specific code
and allow the tester to add arbitrary URLs to link to existing bugs. How to do
integration (even as simple as publishing a comment in the bug tracker) over
a generic interface still eludes me. In the next few weeks I will kick-off this
topic with a separate blog post/issue for everyone to comment on.</p>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Our team spent some time making Kiwi TCMS the first open source TCMS available
on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms">GitHub Marketplace</a>. We will
continue this integration effort and flow integration will emerge from that.
There's also many things that need to be done to satisfy GitHub's .</p>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Our mission is to transform testing in your organization by providing
the tools for that via Kiwi TCMS. It is astonishing that so far nobody has provided
any kind of feedback in <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/703">Issue #703</a>
wrt improving productivity in their teams!</p>
<p>We have some ideas which have been blocked by lack of resources on the team and
refactoring tasks. Because we've adopted this as our mission this is an important
item for us and we'll continue working on it as resources allow.
Progress is to be expected towards the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><em>Status: great, on track, needs work</em></p>
<p>This is our strongest area during the year so far. We have a strong presence in
several communities, our event schedule is busy enough and we are gaining more
recognition every day!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted project stand at 3/5 conferences with 2 more on-track</li>
<li>Won the OpenAward for <a href="2019-06-24-openawards-winner.markdown">Best Tech Community</a></li>
<li>Hosted several presentations and workshops with few more on track</li>
<li>Found new talent to join the core team: 2 just ready to start contributing, 5 more in training</li>
<li>1 more senior engineer as a mentor. We also have a few independent wanna-be contributors
  and will be hosting qualification interviews for marketing assistant very soon</li>
<li>There are contributions and pull requests coming from users of Kiwi TCMS as well.
  We'd like to see more of course.</li>
<li>There are a couple of open source projects and companies using Kiwi TCMS who
  are friendly towards the project. We are working with them to get a public
  endorsement on the website and engage in more technical work together. Of course
  everyone has limited resources and is very busy :-(</li>
<li>Sponsors on <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms#contributors">OpenCollect</a> are just
  a few but we didn't have any previously so this is a good sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the moment to mention that not all is honey and roses in open source land.
Kiwi TCMS suffers from the problem that many of our users can't be contributors
or simply don't want to!</p>
<p>Manual testers can't program. This is a fact and a good sized chunk of our user base
actually performs manual testing. Those that can write automation and probably
code decently well may not be familiar with Python and Django. At least in Bulgaria
these two aren't very popular, definitely not among testers. That is to say this part
of the user-base simply doesn't have the necessary skills to contribute and the majority
of what we need is code contribution!</p>
<p>Another (fairly big IMO) group of users are coming from proprietary companies who
view open source and Kiwi TCMS as a zero cost option. Something that they take free
of charge and use it without ever contributing back. They don't understand nor really
care about the open source culture.</p>
<p>To make things worse we receive requests every single day via
our private email addresses or questions via IM despite our website clearly stating
community engagement rules. On a few occasions we have received very rude comments
of the sort "our company demands you fix this", "is this going to be ready this year"
(context implying entitlement), etc. To make things more ridiculous we've even received
support requests (via contact form) from companies and start-up
who get their return address wrong so we can't get in touch directly!</p>
<p>In short: don't demand anything from us unless you are ready to pay for it, work for it
yourself or propose a mutually beneficial scenario. We do try to keep the community
happy but more importantly follow our mission and develop our core team!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="article">
            <p>On Tuesday I hosted my pylint workshop during the regular
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/295673718035353/">Django Bulgaria meetup</a>.
This edition was the first which was practice based.</p>
<p>Attendance numbers were low but participation was very good. We managed to
create 4 new checkers for Kiwi TCMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/949">PR #949 - AutoField checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/950">PR #950 - OneToOneField checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/951">PR #951 - discover directories without __init__.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/952">PR #952 - empty class checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/955">PR #955 - function based view checker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to all contributors. These new checkers have discovered quite a
few new issues with Kiwi TCMS so this is an area which our team is going to improve.</p>
<p>Those who missed the workshop will be able to catch up one of the next editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>26-29 August, GUADEC, Thessaloniki - TBC (presentation)</li>

<p>Have you ever wanted to be part of an open source team?
Have you ever wanted to contribute back the open source community ?
Have you ever wanted to see your code used by thousands of people ?</p>
<p>If yes now you have the opportunity! Read on to learn how you can help
Kiwi TCMS and how our team can help you.</p>
<h2>Inexperienced Python developer(s)</h2>
<p>It is fine not to have any experience at all! You will compensate with
commitment and hard work. Initially you are going to work on refactoring,
cleaning up pylint errors, removing duplicate code and other issues
reported by <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a>.</p>
<p>By doing this you will have the opportunity to learn git, Python, Django,
some CSS, JavaScript and Patternfly HTML of course. We are going to provide
you with all the learning materials plus help and guidance from existing team members.</p>
<p>Everyone on the team has gone though the same training procedure and grueling tasks
and so will you! Once you can demonstrate progress and learn the ropes you
will continue working on more complicated tasks.</p>
<h2>Experienced Python developer(s)</h2>
<p>So you have some experience already, you've probably contributed code before and are
now looking for more green stripes on your GitHub profile. We've got you covered!</p>
<p>There are many areas to choose from: issue tracker integration, GitHub integration,
GitLab integration, external API library, Kiwi TCMS plugins written in Python and
customized pylint linters! This is going to be where you get your hands dirty and
show your strengths. Our team is here to help if necessary but we expect you to
show progress by yourself.</p>
<p>A challenge for you will be to review pull requests from other contributors and
be patient with less experienced contributors and team members. This is an excellent
opportunity to work on your people skills as well.</p>
<h2>Experienced non-Python developer(s) (with Java)</h2>
<p>Kiwi TCMS is primarily looking for Java developers who will own our test automation
plugins. Currently we have a plugin for JUnit 5 and TestNG is in planning. Maybe
there will be a plugin for Jenkins as well. You are going to own these components
and work solely on them. Unless you decide to learn Python and Django that would
be a very easy job!</p>
<p>.NET, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript ? We don't have a lot of code written in these languages
but you can help change this. The main thing we'd like you to know
(or become familiar with) are the internals of popular test automation frameworks
for these languages and how to create plugins for them.</p>
<h2>QA engineer with Python</h2>
<p>You are going to test a lot! You are going to write test automation a lot! Ideally you
already have a medium level of experience in the software testing field and
want to improve your coding skills and/or get more experience into a different
application domain. We also have Linux and Docker in the mix, just for fun!</p>
<p>Your responsibility will be to design test scenarios for various features (new or existing),
write test automation scripts and help improve overall test coverage and quality
of Kiwi TCMS. You will also check-in on non-Python developers and
help them with test design when necessary.</p>
<p>There are other things that can be tested as well, for example Kiwi TCMS
performance and scalability. Here you will have to get down to the nitty-gritty
stuff and do some profiling to pin-point where the root cause of the problem is.</p>
<h2>Security freak</h2>
<p>We've got <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/kiwitcms-kiwi">Coverity scan</a> and
<a href="https://snyk.io/test/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">Snyk</a> automatically inspecting our
code base. We do have some other tools as well and we know they can never be enough.</p>
<p>You will be responsible for triaging the numerous issues being reported by these
tools and help us decide if they are a real threat or a false positive. For example
Coverity reports hundreds of issues mostly coming from our Python and Node.js dependency
stack. We haven't had the time to classify them and work with upstream communities
to fix them thus the majority of your contributions will be outside of the
Kiwi TCMS code base.</p>
<h2>Graphics designer</h2>
<p>Your main job is going to be creating beautiful images for our website,
blog posts and promotional material. All the images we use are licensed under
Creative Commons which we then modify with the specific Kiwi TCMS look and
feel. This is not going to change, your work will remain under a permissive
license!</p>
<h2>Marketing specialist</h2>
<p>You will be directly responsible for driving more traffic to our website,
interpreting Google Analytics metrics and coming up with creative ideas
how to boost Kiwi TCMS popularity. This means, but not limited to blog posts,
collaborations with other projects and/or bloggers, professional magazines, etc.
You will also be in charge of events and conferences that we go to! Whenever
possible you will be coming with us as well!</p>
<p>A challenge for you will be to learn some technical jargon and learn more
about the software testing profession and software testers in general!</p>
<h2>What's in it for you ?</h2>
<p>You will sharpen your skills! You will use Kiwi TCMS as a platform to
improve your career. You will experience the gratification of our community of users.</p>
<p>This blog is the medium where you can share tips
and tricks and technical articles about interesting features in Kiwi TCMS.
If you'd rather have your personal blog working on Kiwi TCMS will give you lots
of topics to write about.</p>
<p>We go to conferences and meetups too. If public speaking is your thing
you will have plenty of topics to talk about. We can also help you
deliver your first presentation! Everyone on the team has done it!</p>
<p>Our existing team will help you learn and we will help you grow. Our personal time
is the most expensive item we can offer to you! In return we expect you to
fulfill your commitments and when you promise something will be done you will
make sure it is done!</p>
<h2>How to apply ?</h2>
<p>You can figure this out yourself.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="article">
            <p>In
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/02/01/kiwi-tcms-65/">release notes for v6.5</a>
we announced several plugins which will fetch test names and execution results
from your automated test suite.</p>
<p>Plugins can be controlled via environment variables which will affect how
test results are recorded in the Kiwi TCMS database! This blog post is an introduction
how that works and what you can do with it! For this purpose I will be using the
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo">plugin-demo</a> repository, which simulates
real development work.</p>
<p><em>Full documentation and list of available plugins is available in chapter
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html">Automation Frameworks Plugins</a>!</em></p>
<h2>Always create new TestRun by default</h2>
<p>The default behavior is always to create a new TestRun if controlling variables
are not overridden! Product name, version and build will receive default values
if tests are running in Travis CI or Jenkins. For example
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496217246">Travis Build #2</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/d455fb42fb7c2aedadfd5f66de7d131109c03350">commit d455fb4</a>
creates <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/12/">TR-12</a> and
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/10/">TP-10</a>!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=d455fb42fb7c2aedadfd5f66de7d131109c03350
Build=2
</pre></div>


<p>Next we convert the README file from Markdown to reStructuredText which triggers
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496220575">Travis Build #3</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/418b80b3bbb65a799f695dc59d488c76f560fa2b">commit 418b80b</a>.
This build <strong>again</strong> creates a new TestRun and new TestPlan for it. Respectively
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/14/">TR-14</a> and
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/12/">TP-12</a>!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=418b80b3bbb65a799f695dc59d488c76f560fa2b
Build=3
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Important:</strong> we can see that version is different which will affect how artifacts
are organized in Kiwi TCMS, possibly affect how you will report status to stakeholders!</p>
<h2>Override ENV variables for more control</h2>
<p>Let's say the QA team has decided that all test results must be reported under the
same TestPlan. This means version must be the same between various builds in Travis CI!
To control this we export <code>TCMS_PRODUCT_VERSION=master</code> in CI <strong>before</strong> executing
the TAP plugin! Checkout the commit on GitHub to see how it is done!</p>
<p>This triggers
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496223505">Travis Build #4</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/e484e59023caf665e8f93341395af6f397691b93">commit e484e59</a>.
Because this is the first time where Version == master the plugin creates
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a> and reports the results under
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/16/">TR-16</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=master
Build=4
</pre></div>


<p>Right after that I realized we can make this configuration a bit more generic
because our team is planning to support multiple versions of the product and
development will be done in separate branches!
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496228021">Travis Build #5</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/f1f2878d80a7327b54c8e33d1c6d6f14153d6d12">commit f1f2878</a>
still ends up with Version == master because we are still working on the <code>master</code>
branch! That is to say, the product is in active mode of development.</p>
<p>Results are reported in
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/18/">TR-18</a> which is again part of
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=master
Build=5
</pre></div>


<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496229819">Travis Build #6</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/df6153b2495bfc6825f25e544ae1806108aa490f">commit df6153b</a>
adds the new functionality <em>README badges</em> and reports test results in
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/20/">TR-20</a> which is again part of
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<h2>More ENV overrides</h2>
<p>While giving status reports back to stakeholders and developers the information that
we have in the TestRun is Build number! This follows the numbering scheme in Travis CI
(or Jenkins job number) and isn't very useful.</p>
<p>Let's define <code>TCMS_BUILD</code> to be the first 7 characters of the commit hash! When QA
tells devel that something isn't working and redirects them to the TestRun they can
immediately use the Build information and git checkout the offending variant of the product
for investigation.</p>
<p>This results in
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496233565">Travis Build #7</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/bf75d0abe9695e3ee3b49b8944bab9db43bb25e6">commit bf75d0a</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/22/">TR-22</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=master
Build=bf75d0a
</pre></div>


<h2>Report results in pre-existing TestRun</h2>
<p>There are many reasons you may want to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>include both manual and automation tests for the same build;</li>
<li>mix results from multiple test suites for the same build,
  e.g. unit, functional, performance</li>
<li>mix results from multiple but similar platforms in the same build,
  e.g. cross-platform application for iOS and Android</li>
</ul>
<p>To do so I've created <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/24/">TR-24</a> beforehand and
configured <code>TCMS_RUN_ID=24</code> in my CI environment. TR-24 also contains
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/case/57/">TC-57: Verify we can report results from several plugins into the same TR</a>.
this was created and added via the web interface.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> mixing additional test cases can be done either before or after
automation results are reported with the plugin!</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> when reporting results to an existing TestRun Kiwi TCMS plugins
don't care in which TestPlan this TR is! In theory it is possible to report
the results for <code>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo</code> into any TP/TR pair! However we
don't want to do this crazy thing and instead I've created TR-24 inside the already
existing TP-14!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> because I don't know what is the git commit beforehand I've configured
TR-24 with <code>Build=unspecified</code>. If I wanted I could update this with the correct value
once I know the commit hash for the related changes I am testing.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> the plugin-demo repository uses both kiwitcms-tap-plugin and
kiwitcms-junit.xml-plugin at the same time! They differ in the way test names
are compiled! Both are reported in TR-24. See TC-57 text for information how to
distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496237911">Travis Build #8</a> for
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496237911">commit 85ad939</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/24/">TR-24</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=master
Build=unspecified
</pre></div>


<p>Also check-out comments in TR executions to see when and who had executed the test case.</p>
<p>So far there have been some tests which were failing (although Travis reports PASS) so
I decided to fix them.
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496240713">Travis Build #9</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/a25b3841e656d47a7539c608e375cecbf3bed2ac">commit a25b384</a>
is still configured with <code>TCMS_RUN_ID=24</code>. This means results will be reported in
TR-24, effectively overwriting previous results.</p>
<p>Check-out <em>Change Log</em> under each individual execution and you will see several
time stamps when status was updated! In other words, as long as <code>TCMS_RUN_ID</code> is
pointing to an existing TestRun this TR will keep the results of the last test suite execution!</p>
<h2>Continue development, restore ENV configuration</h2>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496243124">Travis Build #10</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/c4f1ae5ecadb249d39923cedbbf53a85e50420b3">commit c4f1ae5</a>
removes <code>TCMS_RUN_ID</code>! Results are reported in
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/25/">TR-25</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=master
Build=c4f1ae5
</pre></div>


<h2>Branch out for an LTS version</h2>
<p>Our team has decided to make the first LTS release of the product. We branch out into
<code>lts-v0</code> branch in git and cut the first NVR. This results in
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496245067">Travis Build #11</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/9f1ef717e3fb248d65535ed66b5c4e61e6f85a6e">commit 9f1ef71</a>
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/27/">TR-27</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/16/">TP-16</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=lts-v0
Build=9f1ef71
</pre></div>


<p>Because this is the first time we are running tests for this product version
we end up with the newly created TP-16!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> see how version was populated with the correct value for the git branch!
This is because my CI config uses <code>TCMS_PRODUCT_VERSION=$TRAVIS_BRANCH</code> and no further
changes were required! I made this change back in Travis Build #5 anticipating what
will come in the future!</p>
<p>The product is now live and customers have reported critical bugs for it:
<em>URLs for the badges in README are wrong</em>! I fix those and add more tests of course, see:
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496247347">Travis Build #12</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/2d72754d3f911ef4e25287f203471f4466b95d12">commit 2d72754</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/29/">TR-29</a> for
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/16/">TP-16</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Product=kiwitcms/plugin-demo
Version=lts-v0
Build=2d72754
</pre></div>


<p>TR-29 contains the new <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/case/58/">TC-58</a>!</p>
<h2>cherry-pick between branches</h2>
<p>In the <code>lts-v0</code> branch customers have identified a serious issue. It doesn't exist on <code>master</code>
but the test is still valid so I cherry-pick it! In git you can backport or forwardport very
easily. Regardless of the direction Kiwi TCMS plugins will record the test results for you.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/builds/496252529">Travis Build #13</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/plugin-demo/commit/31ae5b3358137fde7d2b5c3656b384acc7331d95">commit 31ae5b3</a>,
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/runs/31/">TR-31</a> for
<a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/14/">TP-14</a>.</p>
<p>We can see that TC-58, which was originally implemented on the <code>lts-v0</code> branch
is now present!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a very basic example of how you can organize collection and reporting for
your automation test suite results with Kiwi TCMS. The links here only refer to
artifacts created by <code>kiwitcms-tap-plugin</code> while in the DB we keep others as well.</p>
<p>There are feature requests for more ENV variables which will allow you to control
TestPlan creation and child/parent relationship between test plans. See
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/tap-plugin/issues">https://github.com/kiwitcms/tap-plugin/issues</a> and vote with a <code>:+1:</code> reaction
to help us plan for these features.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS automation framework plugins are nothing more than result parsers
which talk back to a database. It is up to you to decide how to organize the
collection of test results and how to report on them later, when the need arises.</p>
<p>Future installments in this post series will take a look at workflows with
feature branches and pull requests and discuss possible organization scenarios.
You are welcome to share your ideas in the comments below.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="article">
            <p>Hello testers, Kiwi TCMS has taken on a brave new
mission! We would like to transform the testing process by making it more
organized, transparent &amp; accountable for everyone on your team. Our goal
is to improve engineering productivity and participation in
testing. The following blog post outlines how we would like to achieve
this and what goals we put before ourselves for this year.</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p>Last year we took on the challenge to bring a legacy code base up to modern
coding standard. We did not complete that effort but made very good progress
along the way. This is not a small task and that's why our team will continue
with it this year.</p>
<p><img src="/images/codeclimate_jan_2019.png" style="float:none"
     alt="CodeClimate report" title="CodeClimate report"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a>:
  0 issues, 0% technical debt, health score A</li>
<li><a href="https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/kiwitcms/Kiwi/">Scrutinizer</a>:
  only A and B type issues</li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/475946313">Pylint</a>: 0 issues</li>
<li>Remove vendored-in Handlebars, jQuery, jQuery-UI and TableDnD JavaScript
  libraries in favor of existing npm dependencies</li>
<li>Front-end uses the existing JSON-RPC instead of backend views that
  are only used for AJAX requests. Tip: these are usually accessed via
  <code>postToURL()</code> and <code>jQ.ajax()</code> on the front-end</li>
<li>Inspect and classify all 3rd party issues reported from
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/kiwitcms-kiwi">Coverity</a> and
  <a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/475946312">Bandit</a>. Report and fix
  what we can, ignore the rest that do not affect Kiwi TCMS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p>There are 59 templates remaining to be converted to a modern look and feel.
Along with them comes more refactoring and even redesign of the existing pages
and the workflow around them. Together with refactoring this will make Kiwi TCMS
easier to use and also to maintain.</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting</h2>
<p>We are planning to remove the existing reports feature because they are not well
designed. We will re-implement existing functionality that our community finds useful,
add new types of reports (incl. nicer graphics and UI) and make it possible for the
reporting sub-system to be more easily extendable.</p>
<p>Phase out is planned to begin after 1st March 2019! Until then we are looking for your
feedback. Please comment in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/657">Issue #657</a>!</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p>These will make it easier to collect results from automated test suites into
Kiwi TCMS for later analysis. Instead of creating scripts that parse the
results and talk to our API you will only have to install an additional package
in your test environment and configure the test runner to use it! Automation
test results will then appear inside Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin">JUnit 5 plugin</a> - already in progress</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/692">TestNG plugin</a> - RFC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/693">Django plugin</a> - RFC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/694">py.test plugin</a> - RFC</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to use such functionality leave your vote inside GitHub
issues! In case you would like to write a test-runner plugin you can find the
specification
<a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/2018/11/05/test-runner-plugin-specification/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: Does Kiwi TCMS integrate with JIRA?</p>
<p>Answer: Well, it does. How exactly do you want to integrate?</p>
<p>... silence ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following dialog happens every time someone asks me about bug-tracker
integration, especially with JIRA. The thing is integration is a specified
set of behavior which may or may not be desired in a particular team. As of now
Kiwi TCMS is able to open a URL to your bug-tracker with predefined field
values, add comments to bug reports and report a simple summary of bugs
inside a TestRun.</p>
<p>We recognize this may not be enough and together with the community we
really need to define what bug tracker integration means! The broader domain
of application lifecycle management tools (of which TCMS is a sub-set) have an
integrated bug tracking system. We can add something like this and save you
the trouble of using JIRA, however many teams have already invested in
integrating their infrastructure or just like other tools. For example we love
GitHub issues and our team regularly makes public reports about issues that
we find internally!</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/530">Issue #530</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p>Developers have their
<a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub PR flow</a> and if they
have done the job of having unit tests then they will merge only when things
are green! This leaves additional testing efforts kind of to the side and
doesn't really help with transparency and visibility. I'm not going to mention
having an automatically deployed staging environment for every change
because very few teams actually have managed to do this effectively.</p>
<p><img src="/images/github_kiwitcms_pr_status.png" style="float:none"
     alt="Kiwi TCMS statuses on GitHub PR" title="Kiwi TCMS statuses on GitHub PR"></p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Figure out how Kiwi TCMS can integrate with GitHub flow and bridge the gap.
  Please share and <code>+1</code> your wildest ideas in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/700">Issue #700</a>.</li>
<li>Follow up: depending on the results in #700 we will follow with other goals and
  sub-tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p>Speaking of modern engineering flow is your team truly agile? When and how
do you plan your testing activities ? Before the devel sprint or afterwards?
How many testers take part in refining product backlog and working on user stories?</p>
<p>Similar to GitHub flow lots of teams and open source projects are using Trello
to effectively organize their development process. Testing should not be left
behind and Kiwi TCMS may be able to help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Figure out how Kiwi TCMS fits into the overall <code>devel-test-planning</code>
  process for agile teams and what we can do to make this easier for testers.
  Please share and <code>+1</code> your wildest ideas in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/701">Issue #701</a></li>
<li>Follow up: depending on the results in #701 we will follow with other goals and
  sub-tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p>What makes a test engineer productive when they need to assess product risk and
new features, when mapping product requirements documents (PRD) to test plans and
test cases, when collaborating on user stories and behavior specification ?
What makes developers, product owners, designers and other professionals productive
when it comes to dealing with testing ?</p>
<p>For example consider the following workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company has idea for a new product</li>
<li>In case this is a big product it may have its own mission, i.e. what kind
  of problem is it trying to solve and for which group of customers</li>
<li>Product backlog is then created which outlines features that map
  to the product mission</li>
<li>Then the team, together with test engineers perform example mapping
  and discuss and refine the initial feature requirements. User stories
  are created</li>
<li>Behavior specification may also be created</li>
<li>Test plans and test cases are the immediate product of BDD specs and
  desired user stories</li>
</ul>
<p>Later we iterate through the sprints and for each sprint something like
this happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desired product features are planned for development. They must be <em>complete</em>
  at least in terms of requirements, specs and tests</li>
<li>Devel writes code, maybe some unit tests, testers can also write automated tests
  and/or manually verify the current state of the feature being developed</li>
<li>Testing, including exploratory is performed before feature is merged</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>Devel is also part of testing, right? Product owners, UX and interaction
designers as well. Producing quality software product is a team effort!</p>
<p>In every step of the way Kiwi TCMS can provide notification wizards, guidelines
and/or documentation for best practices, facilitate tooling, e.g. to write user stories
and assess them or map out an exploratory testing session, etc. The list
of ideas is virtually endless. We can even go into deep learning, AI and
blockchain but honestly who knows how to use them in testing ?</p>
<p>Our team is not quite sure how this goal will look like 3 months from now
but we are certain that testing needs to happen first, last and all the time
during the entire software development lifecycle. By providing the necessary
functionality and tools in Kiwi TCMS we can boost engineering productivity
and steer the testing process in your organization into a better, more productive
direction which welcomes participation from all engineering groups.</p>
<p>Let's consider another point of view: testing is a creative activity
which is benefited by putting your brain into a specific state of mind!
For example Gherkin (the Given-When-Then language) has the benefit of
forcing you to think about behavior and while doing so you are vocalizing
the various roles in the system, what kind of actions are accepted and
what sort of result is expected! Many times this will help you remember or
discover missing scenarios, edge cases and raise even more questions!</p>

  We will be happy to publish them on our website</li>
<li>Send us a pull request on GitHub</li>
<li><a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">Become a sponsor</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also looking to expand our core team and the list of occasional
contributors. The following are mostly organizational goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: participate in 5 conferences with a project stand</li>
<li>Goal: define how we find, recruit and onboard new team members. The
  foundation is already set in
  <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/3/kiwi-tcms-team-onboarding#testcases">TP-3</a></li>
<li>Goal: clearly mark GitHub issues which are suitable for external contributors
  which don’t want to spend lots of time learning how Kiwi TCMS works under the hood.
  We're going to tag all such issues with the
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/labels/help%20wanted">
    <img src="/images/github_helpwanted.png" style="float: none; margin:0"
         alt="GitHub help wanted" title="GitHub help wanted">
  </a> label</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development policy</h2>
<p>Our team will be working on areas related to the goals above. A <code>+1</code>
reaction on GitHub issues will help us prioritize what we work on!</p>
<p><img src="/images/github_plus_one.png" style="float:none"
     alt="GitHub +1" title="GitHub +1"></p>
<p>Bug fixes and other
issues will be occasionally slipped into the stream and pull requests from
non-team contributors will be reviewed and merged in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>There is at least 1 full day of work that goes behind the scenes when
a new version is officially released: compile changelog, build images and
upload them, create blog post and newsletter announcement, share on social
media, etc. We also deploy on our own Kiwi TCMS instance as a stop-gap
measure before making everything public!</p>
<p>New PyPI tarballs and Docker images will be released every few weeks as
we see fit, this has been our standard process. We try to align releases
with Django's release schedule and try to cut a new version when there are known
security vulnerabilities fixed. However we can't guarantee this will always
be the case!</p>
<p>If you are in a hurry and need something quickly the best option is to
send a pull request, build your own Docker image from source and
maybe consider
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">sponsoring us via Open Collective</a>!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="article">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals in our 2018
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>
(<a href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/25/mid-year-roadmap-status-report/">mid-year update here</a>).
TLDR; goals are completed at 62%. Refactoring legacy code is showing good results,
less so on the front-end side and there are items still in progress!</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> reported
a "D" rating with 600+ code smells and 600+ duplications and a 1 year estimation
to resolve these. We're now down to "C" rating with 171 smells and 203 duplications.</p>
<p>The level of technical debt has dropped from 32.5% down to 17.7% and we have removed
around 14000 lines of Python code and 8000 lines of JavaScript code without
losing significant functionality.</p>
<p>Checkout
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/trends/technical_debt">the stats</a>
for more info!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p><em>Status: almost finished</em></p>
<p>Both pylint and pylint-django have been integrated into our CI workflow. There are even
some custom built plugins that we use. The number of issues reported is down to 100
from 4000+ initially. These are predominantly <code>fixme</code> comments which are also in parts
of the code that are scheduled for removal and refactoring.</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Several views were modified to return pure JSON but we've not
done any targeted work to resolve this issue. A number of other views have been
removed in favor of using the existing JSON-RPC layer.</p>
<p>This is an internal refactoring effort which isn't very visible from the outside.
This is also one of the factors contributing to the high number of removed
source code.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Not much has been done in this area except the occasional refactoring to
JSON-RPC.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p><em>Status: complete</em></p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress, dropped</em></p>
<p>All RPC methods have been documented! The rest of the internals will be documented
as we go along.</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We still carry around jQuery, jQuery-UI and Handlebars.js. They will be
removed once the pages using them are converted to use the Patternfly widgets
library.</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>There are still over 50 HTML templates in <code>tcms/templates/</code> that need to be
refactored into Patternfly. We've been working on them one at a time and will
focus more on this effort in the next couple of months.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Some of the pages have been converted to use Patternfly. The most important pages
that still have a different look and feel are TestPlan view, TestCase view and
TestRun view. These are also the hardest to convert because they have lots of
tabs/components which pull information from various places. Our goal is to create
reusable widgets for the various components (e.g. a list of TestCases) and then
include these components into several different templates to minimize code
duplication.</p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>A number of JavaScript functions have been refactored and removed during the
past few releases but there are still thousands of lines of code left to deal with.
This effort is mostly happening in parallel with the Patternfly redesign.
We still don't have anything to test front-end JavaScript functionality!</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We are seeing a steady stream of new users registered on
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> and
there are several active contributors on GitHub. Most of our translators are
very active and keep their respective languages fresh and up to date!</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS was represented at OSCAL Tirana, DjangoCon Heidelberg, PyCon Prague,
HackConf Sofia, PiterPy St. Petersburg and OpenFest Sofia. We've also been
approved for a project stand at FOSDEM 2019 so watch this blog for more news.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
