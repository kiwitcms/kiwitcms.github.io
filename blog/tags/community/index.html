            <p class="post-meta">Posted by
                    <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/">Kiwi TCMS Team</a>
                on Sat 30 January 2021
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><img alt="&quot;GSoC banner&quot;" src="/images/gsoc/2021/banner.png" title="GSoC banner"></p>
<p>Dear open source hackers, we are happy to share that Kiwi TCMS has
applied to
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code 2021</a>
as a mentoring organization!</p>
<p>While we're very early in the program
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline">timeline</a>
and we still don't know whether Kiwi TCMS will be accepted or not we'd
like to use this opportunity and outline several areas which are good
candidates for GSoC fellows to work on. Some of the tasks are also
eligible for our <a href="/blog/tags/bounty-program/">open source bounty program</a>.
The majority of them require some knowledge of Python and Django.</p>
<h2>Let's Encrypt SSL integration</h2>
<p>By default Kiwi TCMS' container image comes with a self-signed SSL certificate!
This is irritating because all modern browsers issue warnings for that and
the majority of deployments do not have the infrastructure to distribute
the self-signing Certificate Authority certificate files, e.g. make the browser
trust the provided certificate.</p>
<p>This issue is compounded by the fact that production SSL certificates,
issues by a well-known authority must be introduced from the outside. While
this is
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing_docker.html#ssl-configuration">documented</a>
there are fair amount of testers who do not have sufficient proficiency
with Docker to do so.</p>
<p>The result is that we see many Kiwi TCMS deployments in the wild which
completely disable HTTPS and users struggling to configure their SSL
certificates.</p>
<p>An integration with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> would be
a good choice. We've tried a proof of concept but had troubles running
their official client on our container image.</p>
<p>The challenge will be
to use a Let's Encrypt client that is supported on the CentOS Linux
distribution (that's what we use) or a frequently maintained
distribution independent package. Another challenge will be that the
ACME protocol used needs to be able to talk back to the system
asking for a new certificate. In most cases Kiwi TCMS will be deployed
behind a firewall and initial certificate request/renewal requests may be
able to go one way only.</p>
<h2>Securing 3rd party dependencies</h2>
<p>Kiwi TCMS itself uses services and tools like Snyk, npm audit, Coverity and Bandit
against our own and against 3rd party source code. On the other hand
some of our components (e.g. PatternFly) do not perform any kind of
security testing. The starting point to unravel this is
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/871">Issue #871</a>.</p>
<p>As a minimum all issues reported by bandit &amp; coverity against 3rd party
dependencies must be sorted out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out if we execute our tools in the appropriate way as to not
  report unnecessary issues</li>
<li>Dissect all of the issues, especially
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/runs/1608837125?check_suite_focus=true">ones from Bandit</a>,
  report them to their upstream community, discuss and decide how to fix or
  ignore the issue and send a pull request to upstream</li>
<li>Figure out how to keep track/dashboard whether or not all of our runtime
  dependencies are using the same tools as we are (they are either open source
  or free to use for open source projects) since they seem to be good tools</li>
<li>Work with any upstream (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc level dependencies) communities
  to adopt said tools and fix issues as they are discovered</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this will ultimately benefit a broader community than Kiwi TCMS alone.</p>
<h2>Integration with GitHub Actions and GitLab pipelines</h2>
<p>As part of our continuing integration with GitHub we need to have an action
which would report the results to Kiwi TCMS similar to how our
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">automation framework plugins</a>
do!</p>
<p>You should start with GitHub because this is what Kiwi TCMS uses and we can
immediately eat our own dog food. Originally proposed in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/817">Issue #817</a> then moved to
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues/10">github-app #10</a> with a
slightly different focus.</p>
<p>Next (or in parallel) would be similar
functionality for GitLab pipelines, proposed in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1421">Issue #1421</a></p>
<h2>Java hacking</h2>
<p>Kiwi TCMS does have a native
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin">junit-plugin</a> but we are no
experts in Java. In the testing world however Java is a very popular
language and we need help building on top of the existing library and
developing several other tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/692">Issue #692</a> - TestNG plugin</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1072">Issue #1072</a> - Jenkins plugin,
  probably similar in scope to the proposed GitHub/GitLab integration above</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1512">Issue #1512</a> - extension for the
  existing junit-plugin. Similar extension will likely be necessary for the
  TestNG plugin as well</li>
<li>Integration with Katalon Studio proposed at
  <a href="https://forum.katalon.com/t/kiwi-tcms-integration/39817">https://forum.katalon.com/t/kiwi-tcms-integration/39817</a>. There isn't much info to
  begin with so if you have working experience with Katalon Studio it would be
  a plus</li>
<li>Fixing assorted
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/issues">issues in our junit plugin</a></li>
<li>Help upgrade to junit-jupiter v5.7.0, looks like API has changed and our
  plugin doesn't automatically discover the tests.
  See <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/pulls">https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/pulls</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>C# and Objective-C hacking</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/2020">Issue #2020</a> - reporting plugin for
  NUnit, similar to other existing
  <a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">automation framework plugins</a>.
  We're not sure how popular NUnit vs other test runners in the C# world is but
  it could be a good basis for developing future plugins. The challenge here
  is mostly for us since we're a Linux based team</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1316">Issue #1316</a> - reporting plugin
  for <em>Kiwi-bdd</em> a simple BDD for iOS. Again the challenge here would be
  on us since we don't have experience building and testing applications on iOS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Migration to Patternfly v4, possibly with React JS</h2>
<p>The visual component library that Kiwi TCMS uses is called
<a href="https://www.patternfly.org">PatternFly</a>. First it is a standard describing
visual design, widget behavior and development hints for enterprise
applications. Then it provides an actual implementation of their standards.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS is built with PatternFly v3 using raw HTML + CSS. This approach
allowed us to get started quickly and gradually migrate from our legacy UI.
It also works very well with Django which is structured around rendering HTML
templates.</p>
<p>A major task is switching over to PatternFly v4 where there could be some
differences in component syntax.</p>
<p>Since Kiwi TCMS v8.8 and v8.9 we have completely redesigned the
TestPlan and TestRun pages. As they are the ones with the most possible
interactivity and functionality we have hit the need to keep internal state
on the front-end. This is rather cumbersome to manage by hand and calls
for a more modern solution using React. There is PatternFly implementation
as React components too.</p>
<p>The starting point is
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1323">Issue #1323</a>.</p>
<p>The volume of work is a challenge because all pages need to be migrated
and we're not sure if this can be done and released in steps or all pages
should be migrated and released together. In other words we don't know if
shipping UI based on both PatternFly v3 and v4 will work.</p>
<p>The next challenge is refactoring the TestRun and TestPlan pages with
React, keeping all existing functionality intact. A challenge here will
also be the transactional nature of Django where it receives a browser request
and sends a response, usually rendered HTML content! Lots of functionality
happens both on the backend as well as in the HTML templates themselves -
for example translations and permission checks.</p>
<h2>JavaScript hacking</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1281">Issue #1281</a> - start using ESLint
  against our code base and clean-up all related issues</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1910">Issue #1910</a> - replace SimpleMDE
  with EasyMDE. Ideally we would like to depend on other active open source
  libraries and the rich text editor what we use looks like it needs replacement.
  We've got a few extra features hooked into the editor like syntax highlighting
  with dynamic loading of language definitions, support for inline attachments and
  a security override. All of these need to be kept in place.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1919">Issue #1919</a> - reconsider using
  MomentJS. Well it looks like its original authors encourage everyone to
  actually stop using it and we should consider doing so as well. As it stands
  MomentJS is not widely used inside Kiwi TCMS except for timezone conversions
  in the browser. Should be relatively easy to replace, preferably with a vanilla
  JavaScript implementation. Either way we first need to know what actually
  has to be done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remaining telemetry</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Testing Telemetry</a> is one of our cool
features and since we've started to redesign the legacy report feature testers
are very happy with it. There are still some bits and pieces that are missing:
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/616">Issue #616</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1923">Issue #1923</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1924">Issue #1924</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1925">Issue #1925</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1926">Issue #1926</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1927">Issue #1927</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1928">Issue #1928</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1929">Issue #1929</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1940">Issue #1940</a>.</p>
<p>These generally depend on having the ability to record execution times in our
database and afterwards the features are similar but relatively independent
of one another.</p>
<h2>Web hooks</h2>
<p>Kiwi TCMS should be able to better integrate with 3rd party systems.
This feature will allow users to configure custom URL to which Kiwi TCMS will send
HTTP POST requests on certain events. It looks like we can base the implementation
on top of <a href="https://github.com/zapier/django-rest-hooks">django-rest-hooks</a> and
pair it up with <a href="https://restrictedpython.readthedocs.io/">RestrictedPython</a>
for further flexibility.</p>
<p>This feature is being tracked in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1080">Issue #1080</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/914">Issue #913</a> but needs a more
detailed definition.</p>
<h2>Anything else</h2>
<p>All of the proposals above are items which we have in our backlog and
need help with. However participation in the Google Summer of Code program
is not limited only to them. You are free to propose any other ideas/projects
on which you would like to work during the summer. We would be happy to
accept your contributions if we make it into the program.</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
this blog post outlines Kiwi TCMS roadmap for 2021 and what we feel is
important to us!</p>
<p><img style="background-color: inherit" src="/images/roadmap2021.png" alt="roadmap image 2021"></p>
<h1>Project sustainability</h1>
<p>The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means three key areas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">1) Team</span>
<span class="err">2) Technical</span>
<span class="err">3) Community &amp; Adoption</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Right now we have a core team with 3 members, 3 more members on-boarding
and 2 interns. In the past year we weren't successful into turning more
people into core-team members.
I have seen several problems and core-team will significantly reconsider
how we approach &amp; recruit people to join the team, how we on-board and help
them so that they can become productive and fully fledged team members.</p>
<p>Long term focus is improving and strengthening core-team which also implies
a level of responsibility and performance criteria which core-team members
must meet.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance so that
we can operate with a predictable capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> (re)structure internal team processes around candidates and newcomers!
Note: These are not public at the moment.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry features</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining refactoring with major focus in pylint issues, migration to
Patternfly v4 and eslint issues.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> improve SSL configuration with strong bias towards Let's Encrypt being
configured by default.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> provide support for web hooks so that Kiwi TCMS can be integrated more
easily/flexibly with 3rd party systems. We're aiming for Kiwi TCMS to be able to
POST webhooks to external URLs and inform them about events in the system.</p>
<h2>Community &amp; Adoption</h2>
<p>Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success despite not visiting many events. The
open source community spirit is important to us both in terms of technical
collaborations and in terms of features &amp; exposure which drives further adoption
of Kiwi TCMS downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">bug-tracker integration milestone</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> extended GitHub integration via GitHub actions which will report results
into our database. We do have other ideas as stretch goals.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> similar to GitHub actions we're looking towards GitLab pipelines and
similar integration with GitLab.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> continue our collaboration with Major League Hacking Fellowship program.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> apply for the Google Summer of Code program and work with students if selected.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Another year rolls out and despite all difficulties it is by far the
strongest one for Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 physical events and a few virtual ones</li>
<li>12 releases</li>
<li>24 language translations</li>
<li>683 PRs, most of them closed &amp; merged</li>
<li>Reached Issue/PR number 2000</li>
<li>Reached 5000 commits</li>
<li>Reached 8000 registrations via <a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a></li>
<li>Reached 270K downloads via Docker Hub</li>
</ul>
<h2>Status update</h2>
<p>From the <a href="/blog/atodorov/2020/01/17/project-roadmap-2020/">2020 roadmap</a> we've
established 3 main areas to work on. Their completeness scores are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">1) Team - 30%</span>
<span class="err">2) Technical - 70%</span>
<span class="err">3) Community - 100%</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Average score is 65% completion!</p>
<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Overall the team has stalled its growth and improvement. Contributors which
started onboarding a year ago are still under-productive and do not meet
our criteria to become core-team members.
The average team productivity is far beyond the goal of 1PR/week/person.
This is largely due to contributors not being active on their items,
very long periods between pull requests and longer than average time
for closing pull requests.</p>
<p>The only positive side in this area is that core-team has improved its internal
processes, is meeting regularly, discusses issues with
members when they arise and relatively quickly spots problems and acts
on them.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The dominating effort this year was refactoring the remaining legacy UI
and converting everything to PatternFly. The effect of this is
reduced code complexity and improved CodeClimate score/technical debt,
removed vendored-in JavaScript dependencies and lots of unused code
in favor of using the existing API.</p>
<p>Additional work has been done on closing bugs, implementing some features,
integration with new bug tracking systems and improvements around the
telemetry feature.</p>
<p>However there is still a lot of work to be done until all telemetry
pages are complete. There are also around 30 pylint issues remaining
which require internal refactoring and more legacy code cleanup. It's
getting there but it's also getting harder.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>This area turned out to be our strongest one this year. We started
very strong at FOSDEM 2020 and collaborated with multiple communities on
plugins, code &amp; translation contributions, adoption of Kiwi TCMS and
general partnerships around open source.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS got a substantial grant from the Mozilla foundation which
helped bootstrap our open source bounty program and internship
program.</p>
<p>In May we reached 100K downloads on Docker Hub then in October we've
surpassed 200K. Next month we'll reach 300K!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>2020 was definitely a year full with uncertainties and hardship.
It was not what we were used to and there were many ideas and
lead projects that looked very promising in the beginning of the
year but didn't materialize for a multitude of reasons.</p>
<p>Overall Kiwi TCMS, its team and its community did very well and I am
confident that next year we can achieve more together!</p>
<p>Happy Testing and Happy New Year!</p>

            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
recently we had a chat with
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gjorezaharchev/">Gjore Zaharchev</a>,
a QA manager at Seavus and Testing Coach at
SEDC Software Testing Academy in Skopje. Here is their story
and how they use Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sedc.mk/">Seavus Educational and Development Center</a>
is a private company as part of the Seavus Group and a specialized
training center for education of staff in the fields of programming,
design, computer networks and software testing.
Around 90 students pass through their software testing academy every year
with 60 students enrolled thus far. The training program is 6 months
and covers many basic IT skills, manual testing, ISTQB fundamentals and
automation testing. SEDC is located in Skopje, North Macedonia.</p>
<h2>Hands-On Lab Activities</h2>
<p>The study program includes multiple individual and team projects, intermediate
exams and a final project. These are intended to exercise the most commonly used
test design techniques and practice writing up the test scenarios. All
scenarios are written directly in Kiwi TCMS. We've even seen test plans and
test cases created during Christmas and the New Year holidays last year!</p>
<p>The software under test is usually the programs developed by students
from our <em>Academy for Programming</em>, says Gjore.
Later in the program we use real websites in order to show some bugs in the
wild, he continues. On occasion students have found interesting problems with the websites of
<em>Booking.com</em> and <em>WizzAir</em>. They've also managed to find a critical issue on
one of our local systems. These are the trials and tribulations of
teaching &amp; testing in the wild.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kiwi TCMS team still remembers one of Alex's training sessions where we used
the website of an actual cinema. Unfortunately they went out of business
and shutdown the victimized website right in the middle of the session. ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why did you decide to use Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>When searching for a TCMS platform for the academy one of the decisive
factors was cost. By being open source Kiwi TCMS has the side benefit of
having zero initial usage cost which was very important for us.
Regardless of that Kiwi TCMS is very easy to install &amp; setup using Docker,
very easy to on-board new users and generally well received by everyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a huge benefit for students because they can experiment with Kiwi TCMS
and immediately see how some items work when executing testing workflows.
For example they can visualize how a regression test run looks like compared
to a test run for a critical security fix; or they can simulate working in
groups to cover execution of a larger test plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What do your students say</h2>
<p>Overall they like the workflow and can easily navigate within the user interface.
They feel very positive because there is no complexity in the system and
it is very intuitive. One of the areas which often receives questions is
the ability to record test automation results!</p>
<p><em>Answer: Kiwi TCMS has the ability to fetch names and test results directly, via
plugins for several
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">test automation frameworks</a>
while others are on our backlog -
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/692">TestNG</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1072">Jenkins</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/2020">C#/NUnit</a>!
Anyone interested is welcome to </em><strong>Subscribe</strong><em> to each GitHub issue and follow the progress.
Some issues are also part of our
<a href="/blog/tags/bounty-program/">open source bounty program</a> so we urge students to
take a look and contribute!</em></p>
<h2>Anything you want to ask our team</h2>
<p>At SEDC we'd like to know what are your plans for Kiwi TCMS in the future?</p>
<p><em>Answer: Our plans, like our software, are transparent, check-out posts
<a href="/blog/tags/roadmap/">tagged roadmap</a>! For 2020 this is refactoring of the
last remaining legacy bits, continue work on our Telemetry feature and
more work towards integration with various bug trackers and test automation
frameworks. An extension to that is tighter integration with the GitHub
platform!</em></p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>We are happy to announce that Kiwi TCMS is going to partner with
<a href="https://volasoftware.com/">Vola Software</a> to provide 2 interns with
opportunities for hacking open source and bootstrapping their careers!</p>
<p>Vola Software is a custom software development company
in one of the poorest regions of the European Union and a long-time contributor
to their local ecosystem via
<a href="https://school.vratsasoftware.com/">Vratsa Software Community</a>.
They are located in Vratsa, Bulgaria.</p>
<h2>Internship program</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Allexander203">Alexander Tsvetanov</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/vladi1337">Vladislav Ankov</a> are joining the Kiwi TCMS team
for a 10 month adventure until the end of July 2021 with the opportunity
to continue for another year afterwards!</p>
<p>Both Sasho and Vladi are students in the Professional Technical Gymnasium
in Vratsa and are required to work part-time as junior software developers during the
last 2 years of their education. Given that they have very limited practical
experience and the additional red tape around hiring youngsters many software
companies directly avoid such kind of relationship. This creates a catch-22
circle for both employers who are looking to hire somewhat experienced young people
and youngsters who are looking to advance their practical skills.</p>
<p>Here's where Kiwi TCMS steps-in! What better way to improve practical knowledge
than contributing to an actively used and actively maintained open source software!
We are nearing the 200K downloads mark on Docker Hub so changes made by
Sasho and Vladi will be visible to a very big pool of our users and customers!</p>
<p>Both have already started their open source adventure last week and are currently
going through some training. However they were faced with real problems which
resulted in
<a href="https://github.com/python-bugzilla/python-bugzilla/issues/134">bug discovery</a>
and a
<a href="https://github.com/python-bugzilla/python-bugzilla/pull/135">pull request</a> for
<strong>python-bugzilla</strong> underlined by a
<a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue41965">20 years old issue in Python</a>.
How's that for a start ?</p>
<h2>Administrative</h2>
<p>Vola Software is the direct employer for Sasho and Vladi because they have the
necessary permits and experience required for hiring youngsters. Kiwi TCMS is
the direct technical mentor and will be acting as a customer to Vola Software!</p>
<p>Vola Software will be paying a minimal salary to our interns as required by law.
Kiwi TCMS will reimburse the full amount while Vola Software
will be covering their accounting and administrative expenses.
Both Sasho and Vladi will also be eligible for our
<a href="/blog/tags/bounty-program/">open source bounty-program</a> as an extra stimulation!</p>
<p>All expenses will be fully transparent and visible via
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/expenses/">our Open Collective page</a>!</p>

            <p>We are happy to announce that Kiwi TCMS is going to partner with the
<a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source">MLH Fellowship</a>
open source program which is a 12 week internship alternative for
students interested in becoming software engineers.</p>
<p><a href="https://mlh.io">Major League Hacking (MLH)</a> is a mission-driven B-Corp focused
on empowering our next generation of technologists. Every year, more than
100,000 developers, designers, and makers join the MLH community to gain
hands-on experience and build their professional networks.
They are headquartered in the Greater New York Area, USA but operate world-wide.</p>
<h2>Fellowship program</h2>
<p>The Fall 2020 cohort runs between October 5 - December 21 and we're already
into the Contributing phase of the program.
Fellow students will be working on
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues">open issues</a> from our backlog with
a focus on tasks from our
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/4">open source bounty program</a>
but they can really work on any open task!</p>
<p>Once a pull request has been made it will undergo first round code review
by <a href="https://github.com/flosincapite"><em>Cory Massaro</em></a>
who is the dedicated MLH Python mentor. Once Cory gives the +1
each pull request will be reviewed by a member of the Kiwi TCMS core team like usual.</p>
<p>To minimize the risk of conflicts between contributors we are going to apply
the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each MLH fellow would add a comment on the issue they are
  interested in (applies to other contributors too);</li>
<li>The issue will be assigned to them (new);</li>
<li>The issue will be labeled with the
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22MLH+Fellowship%22"><strong>MLH Fellowship</strong></a>
  label (new);</li>
<li>The following comment will be added:
    <em>This issue/bounty has been assigned to an MLH fellow who is currently
    working on it. Pull requests towards the same issue from other contributors
    will not be considered at this time. Please pick something else to work on!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Upon successful completion of tasks all MLH fellows will be eligible to claim their
bounties via <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">our Open Collective page</a>. This is
the same process other contributors go through, there is no difference.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS commits 2 core-team members who will serve office hours
on the <a href="https://discord.gg/w7F55kn">MLH Fellowship Discord</a> server for
couple of hours per week in order to answer questions and keep the ball rolling.
We also commit to having bi-weekly meetings with MLH mentor(s) during the
duration of the program.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS would also like to thank our friend
<a href="https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude">Eddie Jaoude</a> for putting us in touch with MLH
and helping bring this partnership to reality. Thank you Eddie!</p>

            <p>Hello testers, as you know our
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2020/05/26/kiwi-tcms-is-partnering-up-with-pionir/">friends at Pionir</a>
are working on physical hardware which can be used for interactive training and
explanation of the Black-box testing technique. The inspiration
comes from <a href="http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/">James Lyndsay’s Black Box Puzzles</a> and
<a href="http://blog.brainforit.com/2017/02/06/black-boxes-for-black-box-testing/">Claudiu Draghia</a>.</p>
<p>We have the source code of 3 boxes already published at
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/black-boxes">https://github.com/kiwitcms/black-boxes</a> but still missing bill of materials,
design files for 3D printing and some basic instructions how to put everything
together. There was a delay in delivery of some components but most of the work
is close to completion. You may subscribe to
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/black-boxes/issues">issues for each box</a> to follow
the progress! Here are some images &amp; videos from the development process.</p>
<h2>Wason 2-4-6 box</h2>

<p>According to Pionir's own words:
<em>We are testing the salience box and trying to cause emotional effect of an element.
Vuk made a mistake and now he can't turn it off :D. How's that for dogfooding?</em></p>

            <p>We are happy to announce that <a href="https://qgis.org">QGIS</a> has chosen Kiwi TCMS
for the basis of their <em>Quality Assurance methodology and infrastructure</em>
improvement program!
Kiwi TCMS will play a central role in storing test case definitions,
organizing test cycles, and assigning and tracking test executions by testers
from the QGIS community.</p>

        QGIS is a free and open source geographic information system which contains
        desktop, server, web and mobile applications for various operating systems.
        It is an established project with very large and diverse community and also
        one of the very well known open source GIS systems.
    </p>
</div>

<p>The proposal
<a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/180">QEP#180</a> is the
highest voted proposal in the
<a href="http://blog.qgis.org/2020/07/10/qgis-grant-programme-2020-results/">2020 QGIS Grant Program</a>
and has been awarded a budget of 5000€!
This grant will allow the proponents to spend significantly more time setting up the
infrastructure and planning a methodology for manual testing.</p>
<h2>Scope of proposal</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/180">QEP#180</a>
aims to create the necessary infrastructure and methodology to organize and
encourage systematic testing before each QGIS release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a test management system to organize test cycles, assign and track tests execution;</li>
<li>Elaborate and document a methodology to execute testing to help testers;</li>
<li>Resurrect and move the tester plugin to QGIS repositories. Publish it in the QGIS official repository</li>
<li>Create an initial set of relevant test cases;</li>
<li>Organize and execute the initial test cases for the next releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>This effort will steer members &amp; volunteers of the QGIS community towards a more systematic
and organized testing during a feature freeze period before a release. The focus here
is on integration testing, manual &amp; semi-automated workflows for important functionality
that should never regress and is hard or impossible to cover via unit tests.</p>
<p>The proposal is lead by Alexandre Neto, Giovanni Manghi and Alexander Bruy!</p>
<p><br>
On behalf of the Kiwi TCMS community welcome aboard and happy testing!</p>

            <p>We are happy to announce that versioned releases of Kiwi TCMS container
images are now available to customers with an active
<a href="/#subscriptions">enterprise subscription</a>.</p>
<p>For a long time our release policy has been to push only <code>latest</code> version
of our upstream <code>kiwitcms/kiwi</code> containers. This upstream channel doesn't
carry version tags and receives versioned releases only when there are
backwards incompatible database migrations!
This proved challenging to administrators who don't upgrade
immediately to the latest version as soon as it comes out.</p>
<p>For example this happens in environments where admins use the upstream images
as proof of concept and later switch to a production grade installation.
Quite often they migrate to the <em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> containers during the
same time.</p>
<p>Starting today versioned releases of Kiwi TCMS (single tenant) will be available
via the <code>mrsenko/kiwitcms</code> private repository on Docker Hub.
This repository includes tagged versions of the same docker images coming from
the <code>kiwitcms/kiwi</code> channel!
Access is granted automatically to all existing enterprise subscribers!</p>

            <p>We are happy to announce that Kiwi TCMS is going to partner with
<a href="https://pionir.org/">Pionir</a> on the development of open source hardware
for testers!
Pionir is a free school focused on creating a new generation of digital leaders,
an exponential culture and solving challenges using technology. They are located
in Kikinda, Serbia.</p>
<p><img style="background-color:inherit; margin-left:0"
     src="/images/pionir_students.jpg"
     alt="Pionir students"></p>
<p>This is not our first collaboration - the students are already
aware of the Kiwi TCMS project and last year they participated in
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/08/09/kiwi-tcms-conference-presence-aw2019/">presentation &amp; workshop hosted by Alex</a>.
Zamphyr, the organization behind Pionir, is also one of the first open source projects
on our OSS program!</p>
<h2>Black boxes for black-box testing</h2>
<p>Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality
of the subject under test without peering into its internal structures or workings.
It is often performed by manipulating the possible inputs and examining the resulting
output. Experienced black-box testers often develop a hunch for where bugs my be
and it is not uncommon for them to discover some obscure problems nobody else thought
about. More often than not the basis for this is developing an understanding/expectation
how the SUT works by careful exploration during many iterations. Thus being able to
explore a SUT, observe its behavior, keep mental notes about possible relations
between input-behavior-output and analyzing what is happening under the hood becomes
an important skill for testers.</p>
<p>The idea for having something unknown to explore &amp; train your skills first comes
from <a href="http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/">James Lyndsay’s Black Box Puzzles</a> and
was more recently implemented by
<a href="http://blog.brainforit.com/2017/02/06/black-boxes-for-black-box-testing/">Claudiu Draghia</a>.
Now it's our turn!</p>
<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>Pionir will be developing hardware black boxes for teaching exploratory testing in
cooperation with Kiwi TCMS. We have dedicated
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/expenses/18960">€2000 from our bounty program</a>
for students of the free school towards completing this project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of the project is to produce at least 3 boxes and reference designs that will
serve as a didactic tool for teaching, but also be free and open hardware, and as such,
available to everyone to build from source.</p>
<p>This project will be trusted to the students of the free school who will get opportunity
to take part in the challenging process of building a digital appliance,
from designing the machine logic, to develop and prototype hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project includes designing, assembling, programming, documenting and delivering this
hardware to us! Everything is expected to be open source: list of components,
assembly instructions, 3D design files, source code, documentation and instructions!
Our goal is that this will be relatively cheap and easy to build so everyone else
can build their own boxes.
During the next several months there will be new repositories created under
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms">https://github.com/kiwitcms</a> to host the various boxes.</p>
<p>The black boxes are expected to be available in October 2020 - just in time for the
upcoming conference season where members of the larger testing and open source
communities will be able to practice with them!</p>
<h2>Call for sponsors</h2>
<p>We are also calling upon teams and organizations who use Kiwi TCMS in their
testing workflows. Please consider making a one-time donation or
becoming a regular sponsor via our
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms#section-contribute">Collective</a>.
You can contribute as low as € 1! The entire budget will be distributed to the community!</p>

<p>Kiwi TCMS is donating € 10000 (ten thousand euro) to our community to enable more hands working
together and give an opportunity for people to get exposed to open source
contributions. You will help us complete pending tasks faster while
learning something new and receive a bonus for your efforts!
This blog post outlines the rules of our open source bounty program.</p>
<h2>Who is eligible to participate</h2>
<p>Everyone who meets the following criteria is eligible to participate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has an account on <a href="https://opencollective.com">https://opencollective.com</a> - needed to follow program updates
  and request payments</li>
<li>Has a bank account - needed for actual money transfer, more info below!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are beginner in Python, Django or some other technology that we use
please consider available documentation, your local user group, developers forum and
StackOverflow to get help. Do not turn GitHub issues into a
"getting started in programming" discussion.</p>
<h2>Engagement rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Program will be split into multiple rounds as we work to clearly define
  what needs to be done and adjust priorities</li>
<li>News and updates will be posted at <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/updates/">https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/updates/</a></li>
<li>You are expected to mostly work alone on issues</li>
<li>Technical discussion will be happening via GitHub pull requests and/or GitHub issues
  under <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi">https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi</a> unless indicated otherwise</li>
<li>Translation related discussion will be happening via Crowdin under
  <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms/discussions">https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms/discussions</a> when needed</li>
<li>Do not contact individual team members privately, we are going to ignore such messages</li>
</ul>
<h2>FIFO order for code review</h2>
<ul>
<li>Contributions will be reviewed and merged in a rolling <em>first-in-first-out</em> order,
  that is we review 1 PR and while waiting for updates continue on the next in the queue</li>
<li>In case of collisions, multiple contributions that try to resolve the same problem,
  our team will review the first one, then the second one, etc. The pull request
  which is first to pass DoD and code review will be merged and the conflicting ones closed</li>
<li>Please comment on issues and work together with other community members to
  split the work and avoid collisions as much as possible</li>
</ul>
<h2>About issues</h2>
<p>Our team will try to clearly describe each task and what constitutes a
successfully completed task, e.g. <em>definition of done</em> (DoD). If this isn't the case
please ask questions and seek clarification about such tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only Issues under the <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/4">bounty-program milestone</a>
  <strong>AND</strong> labelled with a specific monetary amount are eligible for payout!</li>
<li>Unlabelled issues need further refinement before they can be accepted for bounties!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Payout rules</h2>
<p>Once DoD has been met and the contribution is merged you may claim the assigned bounty.
You must perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/expenses/new">Submit an expense</a> to the
  Kiwi TCMS Collective</li>
<li>All expenses submitted to the Kiwi TCMS Collective must follow the invoicing rules
  of our Fiscal Host.
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-unqsnko4Eaza3fSuVAUFqvhMwe-h1V8jhruTDBjrUY/copy">Here is an invoice template (Google Doc)</a>
  you can use. Fill-in the blue parts and leave the black parts</li>
<li>Invoice &amp; expense description contains the number of issue(s) and PR(s) for which
  bounty is claimed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identity cross validation:</strong></p>
<p>Once an expense has been submitted add a comment with your GitHub/Crowdin username
to it + open a
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/new?assignees=atodorov&amp;labels=&amp;template=claim_bounty.md&amp;title=">new issue in GitHub</a>
/new discussion in Crowdin with link to
the expense submission. This will help us cross-validate that we are talking
to the same person between platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Note on bank transfers</strong></p>
<p>A message from our <a href="https://opencollective.com/europe">Fiscal Host</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We currently prefer to do payouts using bank transfers.
We used to support PayPal but fees were way too high for the collectives.</p>
<p>About bank transfer, we do EU transfers as well as non EU (which takes more time obviously).</p>
<p>We noticed that several collectives are now using Revolut bank accounts which is the
easiest and cheapest way (it’s free) to receive money anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like the fastest &amp; cheapest way to get paid is via Revolut account if you have one,
followed by standard bank transfer and PayPal account is last!</p>

            <p>Kiwi TCMS is the proud winner of a $10,000 award from Mozilla, Indeed,
Open Collective, Ford Foundation &amp; Simply Secure. Read below for the full story!</p>
<p>At the end of January Zahari alerted our team about the
<a href="https://opencollective.com/open-source-speed-dating/events/open-source-speed-dating-fosdem-2020-96f78c6c">Open Source Speed Dating FOSDEM 2020</a>
event and Alex was very swift in filing the application form. Just as we landed
in Brussels, ready to host
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/11/26/kiwi-tcms-is-going-to-fosdem-2020/">Testing and Automation devroom and the Open Source Test Management stand</a>,
we got the news - Kiwi TCMS has been selected as a participant.</p>
<p>What followed was a very hasty day of preparing a 5 min pitch and rehearsing it
as much as possible so we can be ready to present our project. Alex prepared the
pitch and made final review and polishing together with Anton.
For the record everything was written down on paper,
including important facts about the project and schedule - when and where is our slot,
how is Alex going to get there, when does he need to leave to be on time, etc.
We believe that preparation was key here and that's why our team always tries to
be prepared when we participate at events! It was as good
as it can get, no more changes!</p>
<p>On Feb 1st all hell broke loose - it was day #1 of FOSDEM,
the Testing an Automation devroom was full with amazing speakers and packed with people,
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/">watch videos here</a>,
there was barely time to eat or drink water and at 5PM Alex had to rush across town to pitch
Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<p>Then everything went like clockwork - weather was warm for the season,
Alex decided to walk from ULB to La Tricoterie, both so he doesn't get stuck in traffic but
also to regulate stress level and be clear minded for what comes next. He arrived just on
time to meet with new folks and have a glass of wine before taking his turn with the judges.</p>
<p>Open Source Speed Dating is a format where projects pitch to a team of 3 judges who then
follow up with various questions. Their goal is to assess how suitable your project is
for the money they are giving away but also how would actually receiving an award help the project.
You do get guidance how to prepare and what sort of information the judges are looking for.
However you have no idea who the other participants are and who are you competing against!
All you have is a 15 minutes slot where you have to give the best of you and hope it is
enough.</p>
<p>Afterwards we reunited together, did even more walking, played the SPACESHIP at
<em>Let Me Out</em> escape room and finished with a mandatory team dinner in the hearth of Brussels.</p>
<p>Following an internal selection process and due diligence we finally received the award.
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/transactions">$10,000 for open source</a>!</p>
<p>As a side note we also got to know who the other winners are, which can be seen from
<a href="https://opencollective.com/open-source-speed-dating/transactions">Open Source Speed Dating records</a>:
F-Droid, ossia, MNT Research GmbH and Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<h2>We’re giving all of it to our community</h2>
<p>All money from the <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/">Kiwi TCMS Collective</a>
will be going towards funding development tasks.
Like Alex told the judges - this will help us enable more hands working on Kiwi TCMS
and complete pending work faster. Stay tuned for our bounty program announcement!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
