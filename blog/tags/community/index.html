<p><a href="https://www.ami.com">AMI</a>, is an international company,
reimagining firmware for modern computing, providing secure, manageable solutions
across on-premises, cloud, and edge platforms. Its technology and support drive
innovation and lasting partnerships with top tech brands.</p>
<h3>Tell us more about AMI's product lines</h3>
<p>AMI delivers firmware and management solutions for servers, data centers,
and embedded systems. Key products include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aptio V¬Æ</strong>: A next-gen UEFI/BIOS solution enabling dynamic processor and peripheral
  management for Cloud, Edge, and IoT environments.</li>
<li><strong>MegaRAC¬Æ</strong>: Advanced BMC solutions like SP-X and OneTree for remote, OS-independent
  server management, including power control, KVM redirection, and virtual
  media.</li>
<li><strong>TektagonTM</strong>: A Platform Root of Trust ensuring secure and validated firmware boot
  processes.</li>
<li><strong>AMI¬Æ Data Center Manager (DCM)</strong>: Software for managing multi-vendor data centers,
  offering insights on health, power, thermal performance, and sustainability metrics to
  optimize operations and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>AMI develops products at all levels of the technology hierarchy, starting with low level firmware
to cloud based applications. For boot firmware, it's mostly assembly and C.
For manageability firmware, it's a combination of C, C++, Linux Shell scripting.
Our products have web interfaces so the HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack is also very common.
Python is extensively used as the backend language of choice for cloud applications.</p>
<h3>How about AMI's relation to open source</h3>
<p>AMI has forged a robust partnership with the <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/">Open Compute Project</a>,
driving innovation and collaboration in open source firmware solutions. As one of the key proponents of
open source technologies in this space, AMI integrates
<a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2">EDK2</a> and embedded Linux into firmware solutions.
We are a major sponsor of the Open Compute Project and a key contributor.</p>
<h3>What makes testing at AMI challenging</h3>
<p>At AMI, the Test team plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and excellence of our
product lines. Given the dynamic nature of our projects, the team frequently transitions
between tasks to accommodate multiple ongoing initiatives. This adaptability is crucial in
maintaining rigorous standards across diverse firmware and management solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Test team is committed to delivering valuable insights by analyzing
quality trends and producing detailed reports. These analyses equip leadership with actionable
data, fostering informed decision-making and continuous improvement across all
development efforts.</p>
<p><em>Constantly changing priorities combined with the need to provide accurate
reporting make testing at AMI challenging!</em></p>
<p>Since we are a black box/acceptance test group, our System Under Test are actual hardware platforms.
And since we do boot firmware and manageability firmware solutions, we have to test on
early revision hardware, which is unstable. This makes test automation challenging.
And even for automation, we have to rely on hardware tooling like IP controlled AC power strips,
firmware programming devices and single board computers like Raspberry Pi for controlling various
aspects of the system under test. We also support multiple hardware architectures, 
which increases the breadth of what we need to test.</p>
<h3>How do teams at AMI approach testing? Can you walk us through the process</h3>
<p>Our black-box user acceptance testing (UAT) team ensures end-user expectations align
with product functionality, performance, and usability. Collaborating with developers and
studying standards and specifications, we create detailed test scenarios covering positive,
negative, performance, and usability aspects.</p>
<p>Using a hybrid agile-like model, we test features as they're ready and conduct a final
integration cycle to assess system readiness. Given that we work with firmware and
embedded solutions, achieving 100% test automation is a significant challenge. As a
result, our approach includes a considerable amount of manual testing to ensure thorough
coverage and reliability. This process ensures seamless component interactions, uncovers
overlooked issues, and delivers actionable insights so we can ship
high-quality systems that exceed user expectations.</p>
<p>AMI is committed to upholding rigorous standards in testing, including a strict test exit
criterion that mandates zero high severity bugs before product release. This ensures that all
solutions delivered to clients meet the highest levels of reliability and performance. Our
testing methodologies are designed to identify and resolve any critical issues at an early
stage, preventing them from affecting the functionality of end products.</p>
<h3>What other technologies does testing at AMI involve</h3>
<p>At AMI, testing leverages tools like Python for automation scripting and Robot Framework
for test case creation and execution.
Previously, AMI utilized a custom-built test management system to organize test cases and
generate actionable reports.</p>
<p>AMI uses GitLab CI for triggering test jobs.
We have CI workflows that execute daily and weekly runs of our automated tests.
We would like to get to a point where our systems can
analyse what features a code change impacts and then it selects the test cases needed to
execute to test that changeset.</p>
<h3>Why did you decide to use Kiwi TCMS</h3>
<p>The legacy homegrown tool faced significant limitations as it struggled to keep up with the
scaling demands of AMI's growing testing infrastructure.
It was slow and could no longer support our evolving need for real-time reporting,
lacked flexibility, and was unable to accommodate new features, primarily due to the absence
of dedicated personnel to maintain and upgrade it. These constraints led the QA team to seek modern
solutions capable of addressing their evolving requirements effectively.</p>
<p>We conducted extensive research into alternative solutions, but
many tools we evaluated were either overly complex or prohibitively expensive. Kiwi TCMS
emerged as the perfect choice, seamlessly aligning with our requirements for affordability
and functionality.</p>
<h3>Where does Kiwi TCMS fit into AMI's overall testing infrastructure</h3>
<p>Kiwi TCMS has become a mission-critical tool for us, drastically
reducing latency while maintaining a lightweight and responsive design. Its versatility
ensures widespread use across AMI's testing infrastructure, benefiting not just testers but
also project managers and developers. The integration with JIRA further enhances our
workflow efficiency.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Kiwi TCMS API and the <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/tcms-api/">tcms-api</a>
client-side library are a great foundation which
enables us to create custom integrations, allowing
the AMI team to develop tailored workflows that fit their unique requirements.</p>
<p>For example, we have built a custom web application which provides
data visualizations and reporting capabilities that are tailored to meet the needs of our
stakeholders and customers. These custom solutions empower the QA team to provide actionable insights
into testing quality, enhancing transparency and fostering trust across all levels of
collaboration within our organization.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the words of <em>Utpal Patel, Senior Director, Global Test Engineering</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a highly successful two-year run with Kiwi TCMS, we have transitioned
to a <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription to better accommodate the rapid growth at AMI. This move
underscores our commitment to leveraging Kiwi TCMS as a cornerstone of our testing
infrastructure. We're excited about collaborating closely with the Kiwi TCMS development
team to refine it further, introducing features and capabilities that not only
strengthen our own workflows but also contribute valuable enhancements for the broader
testing community.</p>

<p>For more than 25 years,
<a href="https://www.siu.edu.ar/">Sistema de Informaci√≥n Universitaria</a> - SIU - has been
developing solutions for the digital management of the Argentine university
system and various government agencies.</p>
<p>This ecosystem of solutions integrates all management areas within an institution
(administrative, financial, academic, human resources, purchasing and assets, data analysis),
optimizing process management, data quality, transparency, and decision-making.</p>
<p>One of the main pillars of SIU is its collaborative network based on communities of practice.
In these communities, users interact, exchange knowledge and best practices,
solve common challenges, and share experiences. This governance model has gained national and
international recognition and has enabled successful implementations in over 140 institutions.</p>
<h3>The Kiwi TCMS experience</h3>
<p>In recent years, digital transformation and the evolution of the institution
have led SIU to move from a structure based on specific solutions to integrated
project management, requiring the search for new tools to streamline and improve
software development. As part of this process, a test management system was evaluated.</p>
<p>This experience began with the <strong>Integrated Electronic File</strong> solution,
a tool designed to seamlessly manage documents and files within an institution.
One of its components, <strong>SUDOCU</strong> (Unique Document System), was developed by
<a href="https://www.ungs.edu.ar/">Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento</a> - UNGS -
and made available to the Argentine university system through SIU.
This feature added complexity for the QA team during their work,
as test cases had to be replicated on different platforms both on the SIU and UNGS sides.</p>
<p>In order to simplify processes and avoid duplicated efforts, a tool was sought
to streamline the workflow. After evaluating several options, Kiwi TCMS was selected
because of its open source nature, which is in line with SIU's policy.</p>
<p>Evaluation began with a local installation, testing its functionalities,
and optimizing its use to improve workflow. After adjustments in both test and production environments,
Kiwi TCMS was incorporated into SUDOCU's projects, creating test cases and test plans.
This improved the organization and visibility of testing activities for the entire team involved,
including QAs, developers, and analysts.</p>
<p>Based on this initial implementation, a work plan was created to gradually integrate testing
of more projects into Kiwi TCMS, taking into account the unique characteristics of the SIU ecosystem.</p>
<p>Currently, a consolidated QA team has been established within SIU,
working in a fully integrated manner. Other projects are now using Kiwi TCMS in their daily
operations for functional testing, system integration, regression testing and smoke testing.</p>
<h3>Impact and benefits</h3>
<p>The experience with Kiwi TCMS has enhanced the quality of software developed by
SIU by centralizing test cases, test plans and test executions.
This has improved both the traceability and transparency of QA work.
It also provided the ability to generate reports and metrics to further
evaluate and improve internal processes.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits for SIU is time optimization achieved by
reusing test cases and test plans,
as well as the ability to track an unlimited number of executions,
within the same test management tool.
In addition, Kiwi TCMS' integration with <strong>Gitlab</strong> and <strong>Redmine</strong> is very useful
for the institution, as these are other tools commonly used within SIU.</p>
<p>The flexibility of this system allows test cases to be extended as needed,
making it easier to adjust and update test cases or test plans in response to the development cycle.</p>
<p>In the words of <em>Lucas del Reguero Martinez, QA tester</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The implementation of Kiwi TCMS has provided significant advantages to the institution,
resulting in tangible benefits to users within the SIU community.
The plan for the future is to continue training teams on the tool to further democratize its use.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a> is a public research university
in Salt Lake City, USA. It is the flagship institution of the
Utah System of Higher Education and was established in 1850.</p>
<p>The University of Utah's
<a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/">School of Computing</a>, founded as the Computer Science Department
in 1965, has a long and distinguished record of high impact research.
The university has provided large, automated testbeds since around the year 2000,
funded by the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.flux.utah.edu/">Flux Research Group</a> conducts research in operating systems,
networking, security, and virtualization. The group consists of three faculty and over
two dozen research staff, graduate students, and undergrads.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.powderwireless.net/">POWDER</a>
(the Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven Experimental Research) is flexible infrastructure
enabling a wide range of software-defined experiments on the future of wireless networks.
POWDER supports software-programmable experimentation on 5G and beyond, massive MIMO, ORAN,
spectrum sharing and CBRS, RF monitoring,
and anything else that can be supported on software-defined radios.</p>
<p>In the words of David M. Johnson, research staff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The addition of Kiwi TCMS to our POWDER mobile wireless testbed helps to support
the complex multi-system, end-to-end functional test and integration scenarios
we see in the 5G/O-RAN/beyond mobile wireless space.</p>
<p>We use Kiwi TCMS as part of an on-demand environment that POWDER provides to users
that can help them automate testing using a workflow approach,
from CI-triggered orchestration from scratch in our cloud-like environment,
through resource configuration and running test suites,
to finally collecting results into private instances of Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<p>We use both the Stackstorm and Dagster workflow engines to execute our test and integration workflows.
The <a href="https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/powder-workflows/stackstorm-kiwitcms">stackstorm-kiwitcms</a>
library is a simple Stackstorm "integration pack"
(Python source code in this case) that invokes and re-exports much of the core Kiwi TCMS XML-RPC API
(with some minor sugar) into Stackstorm, so that each API function is exposed as a Stackstorm action
(the fundamental unit of its workflows). This means that the workflows can orchestrate resources
into test scenarios; configure the resources; create or instantiate Kiwi TCMS test runs/executions/metadata;
execute tests; and push test results/status into Kiwi TCMS records, upload attachments, etc, for persistence.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/powderrenewpublic/kiwi">a fork</a> of Kiwi TCMS right now
so that we could upload attachments to test runs via the API.
That was a trivial change which
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/9344e2873a48da477ac565362689e4851c34214e">made its way upstream</a>
as part of Kiwi TCMS version 12.1.</p>

<p>The course is part of Offsec‚Äôs fundamentals package which is designed as baseline knowledge
and skills for all security professionals and in particular for those who wish to progress
to the OffSec Defence Analyst (OSDA) certification.  The Assurance Testing course,
and the Kiwi TCMS tool which it uses, gives developers and security testers alike a good
understanding of the best practice approach to test case management and helps build their
skills in carrying out testing in a disciplined way. Using Kiwi TCMS provides the
opportunity to improve the processes and documentation around security testing,
and around the wider functional testing as well.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS bridges the gap between security requirements and software development by
enabling standardized test cases to be developed by the security team whilst
software developers and dedicated QA teams can use these same test cases to ensure that
security requirements are met. With preset test plans and test cases,
execution of security tests can proceed in the same way as for any other non-functional testing,
and any issues identified during testing can be fixed and tests can be executed again.</p>
<p>Learning how to use Kiwi TCMS as part of the Introduction to Assurance Testing course helps
both security teams and QA teams work together in a common environment to improve
the quality and security of their software. Using Kiwi TCMS enables security teams to
provide clear instructions to QA teams as to how to use specialist security testing tools.
For example, having clear test cases for running the PowerShell audit tool
for the Active Directory Certificate Server, PSPKIAudit, means that the test team can take advantage
of a powerful testing tool without needing the specialist knowledge that might otherwise be required
to use and interpret the results of such a tool.</p>

During FOSDEM we are going to see topics around functional testing for the Linux kernel,
growing testing infrastructure for Linux, testing of new networking protocols, observability-driven
development, the testing history behind the GNOME desktop environment, property-based testing
and mutation testing.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> devroom will take place 09:00 to 12:50, Sunday, February 5th 2023 at

<li>Address the automated testing frameworks fragmentation</li>
<li>Lessons learned from testing</li>

<p>Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)</p>

                    <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/">Kiwi TCMS Team</a>
                on Sat 30 January 2021
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><img alt="&quot;GSoC banner&quot;" src="/images/gsoc/2021/banner.png" title="GSoC banner"></p>
<p>Dear open source hackers, we are happy to share that Kiwi TCMS has
applied to
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code 2021</a>
as a mentoring organization!</p>
<p>While we're very early in the program
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline">timeline</a>
and we still don't know whether Kiwi TCMS will be accepted or not we'd
like to use this opportunity and outline several areas which are good
candidates for GSoC fellows to work on. Some of the tasks are also
eligible for our <a href="/blog/tags/bounty-program/">open source bounty program</a>.
The majority of them require some knowledge of Python and Django.</p>
<h2>Let's Encrypt SSL integration</h2>
<p>By default Kiwi TCMS' container image comes with a self-signed SSL certificate!
This is irritating because all modern browsers issue warnings for that and
the majority of deployments do not have the infrastructure to distribute
the self-signing Certificate Authority certificate files, e.g. make the browser
trust the provided certificate.</p>
<p>This issue is compounded by the fact that production SSL certificates,
issues by a well-known authority must be introduced from the outside. While
this is
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing_docker.html#ssl-configuration">documented</a>
there are fair amount of testers who do not have sufficient proficiency
with Docker to do so.</p>
<p>The result is that we see many Kiwi TCMS deployments in the wild which
completely disable HTTPS and users struggling to configure their SSL
certificates.</p>
<p>An integration with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> would be
a good choice. We've tried a proof of concept but had troubles running
their official client on our container image.</p>
<p>The challenge will be
to use a Let's Encrypt client that is supported on the CentOS Linux
distribution (that's what we use) or a frequently maintained
distribution independent package. Another challenge will be that the
ACME protocol used needs to be able to talk back to the system
asking for a new certificate. In most cases Kiwi TCMS will be deployed
behind a firewall and initial certificate request/renewal requests may be
able to go one way only.</p>
<h2>Securing 3rd party dependencies</h2>
<p>Kiwi TCMS itself uses services and tools like Snyk, npm audit, Coverity and Bandit
against our own and against 3rd party source code. On the other hand
some of our components (e.g. PatternFly) do not perform any kind of
security testing. The starting point to unravel this is
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/871">Issue #871</a>.</p>
<p>As a minimum all issues reported by bandit &amp; coverity against 3rd party
dependencies must be sorted out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out if we execute our tools in the appropriate way as to not
  report unnecessary issues</li>
<li>Dissect all of the issues, especially
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/runs/1608837125?check_suite_focus=true">ones from Bandit</a>,
  report them to their upstream community, discuss and decide how to fix or
  ignore the issue and send a pull request to upstream</li>
<li>Figure out how to keep track/dashboard whether or not all of our runtime
  dependencies are using the same tools as we are (they are either open source
  or free to use for open source projects) since they seem to be good tools</li>
<li>Work with any upstream (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc level dependencies) communities
  to adopt said tools and fix issues as they are discovered</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this will ultimately benefit a broader community than Kiwi TCMS alone.</p>
<h2>Integration with GitHub Actions and GitLab pipelines</h2>
<p>As part of our continuing integration with GitHub we need to have an action
which would report the results to Kiwi TCMS similar to how our
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">automation framework plugins</a>
do!</p>
<p>You should start with GitHub because this is what Kiwi TCMS uses and we can
immediately eat our own dog food. Originally proposed in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/817">Issue #817</a> then moved to
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues/10">github-app #10</a> with a
slightly different focus.</p>
<p>Next (or in parallel) would be similar
functionality for GitLab pipelines, proposed in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1421">Issue #1421</a></p>
<h2>Java hacking</h2>
<p>Kiwi TCMS does have a native
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin">junit-plugin</a> but we are no
experts in Java. In the testing world however Java is a very popular
language and we need help building on top of the existing library and
developing several other tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/692">Issue #692</a> - TestNG plugin</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1072">Issue #1072</a> - Jenkins plugin,
  probably similar in scope to the proposed GitHub/GitLab integration above</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1512">Issue #1512</a> - extension for the
  existing junit-plugin. Similar extension will likely be necessary for the
  TestNG plugin as well</li>
<li>Integration with Katalon Studio proposed at
  <a href="https://forum.katalon.com/t/kiwi-tcms-integration/39817">https://forum.katalon.com/t/kiwi-tcms-integration/39817</a>. There isn't much info to
  begin with so if you have working experience with Katalon Studio it would be
  a plus</li>
<li>Fixing assorted
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/issues">issues in our junit plugin</a></li>
<li>Help upgrade to junit-jupiter v5.7.0, looks like API has changed and our
  plugin doesn't automatically discover the tests.
  See <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/pulls">https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/pulls</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>C# and Objective-C hacking</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/2020">Issue #2020</a> - reporting plugin for
  NUnit, similar to other existing
  <a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">automation framework plugins</a>.
  We're not sure how popular NUnit vs other test runners in the C# world is but
  it could be a good basis for developing future plugins. The challenge here
  is mostly for us since we're a Linux based team</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1316">Issue #1316</a> - reporting plugin
  for <em>Kiwi-bdd</em> a simple BDD for iOS. Again the challenge here would be
  on us since we don't have experience building and testing applications on iOS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Migration to Patternfly v4, possibly with React JS</h2>
<p>The visual component library that Kiwi TCMS uses is called
<a href="https://www.patternfly.org">PatternFly</a>. First it is a standard describing
visual design, widget behavior and development hints for enterprise
applications. Then it provides an actual implementation of their standards.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS is built with PatternFly v3 using raw HTML + CSS. This approach
allowed us to get started quickly and gradually migrate from our legacy UI.
It also works very well with Django which is structured around rendering HTML
templates.</p>
<p>A major task is switching over to PatternFly v4 where there could be some
differences in component syntax.</p>
<p>Since Kiwi TCMS v8.8 and v8.9 we have completely redesigned the
TestPlan and TestRun pages. As they are the ones with the most possible
interactivity and functionality we have hit the need to keep internal state
on the front-end. This is rather cumbersome to manage by hand and calls
for a more modern solution using React. There is PatternFly implementation
as React components too.</p>
<p>The starting point is
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1323">Issue #1323</a>.</p>
<p>The volume of work is a challenge because all pages need to be migrated
and we're not sure if this can be done and released in steps or all pages
should be migrated and released together. In other words we don't know if
shipping UI based on both PatternFly v3 and v4 will work.</p>
<p>The next challenge is refactoring the TestRun and TestPlan pages with
React, keeping all existing functionality intact. A challenge here will
also be the transactional nature of Django where it receives a browser request
and sends a response, usually rendered HTML content! Lots of functionality
happens both on the backend as well as in the HTML templates themselves -
for example translations and permission checks.</p>
<h2>JavaScript hacking</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1281">Issue #1281</a> - start using ESLint
  against our code base and clean-up all related issues</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1910">Issue #1910</a> - replace SimpleMDE
  with EasyMDE. Ideally we would like to depend on other active open source
  libraries and the rich text editor what we use looks like it needs replacement.
  We've got a few extra features hooked into the editor like syntax highlighting
  with dynamic loading of language definitions, support for inline attachments and
  a security override. All of these need to be kept in place.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1919">Issue #1919</a> - reconsider using
  MomentJS. Well it looks like its original authors encourage everyone to
  actually stop using it and we should consider doing so as well. As it stands
  MomentJS is not widely used inside Kiwi TCMS except for timezone conversions
  in the browser. Should be relatively easy to replace, preferably with a vanilla
  JavaScript implementation. Either way we first need to know what actually
  has to be done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remaining telemetry</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Testing Telemetry</a> is one of our cool
features and since we've started to redesign the legacy report feature testers
are very happy with it. There are still some bits and pieces that are missing:
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/616">Issue #616</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1923">Issue #1923</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1924">Issue #1924</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1925">Issue #1925</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1926">Issue #1926</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1927">Issue #1927</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1928">Issue #1928</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1929">Issue #1929</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1940">Issue #1940</a>.</p>
<p>These generally depend on having the ability to record execution times in our
database and afterwards the features are similar but relatively independent
of one another.</p>
<h2>Web hooks</h2>
<p>Kiwi TCMS should be able to better integrate with 3rd party systems.
This feature will allow users to configure custom URL to which Kiwi TCMS will send
HTTP POST requests on certain events. It looks like we can base the implementation
on top of <a href="https://github.com/zapier/django-rest-hooks">django-rest-hooks</a> and
pair it up with <a href="https://restrictedpython.readthedocs.io/">RestrictedPython</a>
for further flexibility.</p>
<p>This feature is being tracked in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1080">Issue #1080</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/914">Issue #913</a> but needs a more
detailed definition.</p>
<h2>Anything else</h2>
<p>All of the proposals above are items which we have in our backlog and
need help with. However participation in the Google Summer of Code program
is not limited only to them. You are free to propose any other ideas/projects
on which you would like to work during the summer. We would be happy to
accept your contributions if we make it into the program.</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

            <p>Hello testers,
this blog post outlines Kiwi TCMS roadmap for 2021 and what we feel is
important to us!</p>
<p><img style="background-color: inherit" src="/images/roadmap2021.png" alt="roadmap image 2021"></p>
<h1>Project sustainability</h1>
<p>The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means three key areas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Team</span>
<span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Technical</span>
<span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Community</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">&amp;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Adoption</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Right now we have a core team with 3 members, 3 more members on-boarding
and 2 interns. In the past year we weren't successful into turning more
people into core-team members.
I have seen several problems and core-team will significantly reconsider
how we approach &amp; recruit people to join the team, how we on-board and help
them so that they can become productive and fully fledged team members.</p>
<p>Long term focus is improving and strengthening core-team which also implies
a level of responsibility and performance criteria which core-team members
must meet.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance so that
we can operate with a predictable capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> (re)structure internal team processes around candidates and newcomers!
Note: These are not public at the moment.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry features</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining refactoring with major focus in pylint issues, migration to
Patternfly v4 and eslint issues.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> improve SSL configuration with strong bias towards Let's Encrypt being
configured by default.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> provide support for web hooks so that Kiwi TCMS can be integrated more
easily/flexibly with 3rd party systems. We're aiming for Kiwi TCMS to be able to
POST webhooks to external URLs and inform them about events in the system.</p>
<h2>Community &amp; Adoption</h2>
<p>Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success despite not visiting many events. The
open source community spirit is important to us both in terms of technical
collaborations and in terms of features &amp; exposure which drives further adoption
of Kiwi TCMS downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">bug-tracker integration milestone</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> extended GitHub integration via GitHub actions which will report results
into our database. We do have other ideas as stretch goals.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> similar to GitHub actions we're looking towards GitLab pipelines and
similar integration with GitLab.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> continue our collaboration with Major League Hacking Fellowship program.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> apply for the Google Summer of Code program and work with students if selected.</p>
