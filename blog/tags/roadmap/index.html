            <p>Hello testers,
this blog post outlines Kiwi TCMS roadmap for 2021 and what we feel is
important to us!</p>
<p><img style="background-color: inherit" src="/images/roadmap2021.png" alt="roadmap image 2021"></p>
<h1>Project sustainability</h1>
<p>The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means three key areas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Team</span>
<span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Technical</span>
<span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Community</span> <span class="err">&amp;</span> <span class="n">Adoption</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Right now we have a core team with 3 members, 3 more members on-boarding
and 2 interns. In the past year we weren't successful into turning more
people into core-team members.
I have seen several problems and core-team will significantly reconsider
how we approach &amp; recruit people to join the team, how we on-board and help
them so that they can become productive and fully fledged team members.</p>
<p>Long term focus is improving and strengthening core-team which also implies
a level of responsibility and performance criteria which core-team members
must meet.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance so that
we can operate with a predictable capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> (re)structure internal team processes around candidates and newcomers!
Note: These are not public at the moment.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry features</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining refactoring with major focus in pylint issues, migration to
Patternfly v4 and eslint issues.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> improve SSL configuration with strong bias towards Let's Encrypt being
configured by default.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> provide support for web hooks so that Kiwi TCMS can be integrated more
easily/flexibly with 3rd party systems. We're aiming for Kiwi TCMS to be able to
POST webhooks to external URLs and inform them about events in the system.</p>
<h2>Community &amp; Adoption</h2>
<p>Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success despite not visiting many events. The
open source community spirit is important to us both in terms of technical
collaborations and in terms of features &amp; exposure which drives further adoption
of Kiwi TCMS downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">bug-tracker integration milestone</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> extended GitHub integration via GitHub actions which will report results
into our database. We do have other ideas as stretch goals.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> similar to GitHub actions we're looking towards GitLab pipelines and
similar integration with GitLab.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> continue our collaboration with Major League Hacking Fellowship program.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> apply for the Google Summer of Code program and work with students if selected.</p>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Another year rolls out and despite all difficulties it is by far the
strongest one for Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 physical events and a few virtual ones</li>
<li>12 releases</li>
<li>24 language translations</li>
<li>683 PRs, most of them closed &amp; merged</li>
<li>Reached Issue/PR number 2000</li>
<li>Reached 5000 commits</li>
<li>Reached 8000 registrations via <a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a></li>
<li>Reached 270K downloads via Docker Hub</li>
</ul>
<h2>Status update</h2>
<p>From the <a href="/blog/atodorov/2020/01/17/project-roadmap-2020/">2020 roadmap</a> we've
established 3 main areas to work on. Their completeness scores are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Team</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mf">30</span><span class="err">%</span>
<span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Technical</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mf">70</span><span class="err">%</span>
<span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Community</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mf">100</span><span class="err">%</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Average score is 65% completion!</p>
<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Overall the team has stalled its growth and improvement. Contributors which
started onboarding a year ago are still under-productive and do not meet
our criteria to become core-team members.
The average team productivity is far beyond the goal of 1PR/week/person.
This is largely due to contributors not being active on their items,
very long periods between pull requests and longer than average time
for closing pull requests.</p>
<p>The only positive side in this area is that core-team has improved its internal
processes, is meeting regularly, discusses issues with
members when they arise and relatively quickly spots problems and acts
on them.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The dominating effort this year was refactoring the remaining legacy UI
and converting everything to PatternFly. The effect of this is
reduced code complexity and improved CodeClimate score/technical debt,
removed vendored-in JavaScript dependencies and lots of unused code
in favor of using the existing API.</p>
<p>Additional work has been done on closing bugs, implementing some features,
integration with new bug tracking systems and improvements around the
telemetry feature.</p>
<p>However there is still a lot of work to be done until all telemetry
pages are complete. There are also around 30 pylint issues remaining
which require internal refactoring and more legacy code cleanup. It's
getting there but it's also getting harder.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>This area turned out to be our strongest one this year. We started
very strong at FOSDEM 2020 and collaborated with multiple communities on
plugins, code &amp; translation contributions, adoption of Kiwi TCMS and
general partnerships around open source.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS got a substantial grant from the Mozilla foundation which
helped bootstrap our open source bounty program and internship
program.</p>
<p>In May we reached 100K downloads on Docker Hub then in October we've
surpassed 200K. Next month we'll reach 300K!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>2020 was definitely a year full with uncertainties and hardship.
It was not what we were used to and there were many ideas and
lead projects that looked very promising in the beginning of the
year but didn't materialize for a multitude of reasons.</p>
<p>Overall Kiwi TCMS, its team and its community did very well and I am
confident that next year we can achieve more together!</p>
<p>Happy Testing and Happy New Year!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
the Kiwi TCMS team sat down together last week and talked about what we feel
is important for us during the upcoming year. This blog post outlines our
roadmap for 2020!</p>
<p><img style="background-color: inherit" src="/images/roadmap2020.png" alt="roadmap image 2020"></p>
<h1>Project sustainability</h1>
<p>The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means several key areas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Team</span>
<span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Technical</span>
<span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Community</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Right now we have a core team with 6 newcomers on-boarding.
Engineering performance is all over the place with some people contributing
too much while others contributing too little. More importantly there is no
consistent pace of contributions which makes planning timely completion of
technical tasks impossible.</p>
<p>At the moment we do operate as a bunch of disconnected people who happen to
talk to each other from time to time.</p>
<p>We are going to adjust our internal processes and how we on-board new members.
In fact we did our first "scrum-like" meeting this week and agreed to change
our existing practice and strive to become better as a team!</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> to have a cohesive team at the end of the year which operates with
a predictable capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry features</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">bug-tracker integration milestone</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> all pylint issues resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> migrate all remaining legacy templates to Patternfly UI. See
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/3">patternfly-migration</a> milestone.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> where FE sends AJAX requests to BE views replace with JSON RPC API instead.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> start tackling the JavaScript mess that we have. This depends and is related
to Patternfly migration and overall refactoring.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> make it easier for downstream installations to extend and override parts
of Kiwi TCMS in order for users to adjust the system to their own needs.
The system is pretty flexible as-is but there have been requests,
both online and offline, to provide some extra features! We'll start looking
into them, likely making partial progress in the next 12 months.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success at every single conference that we've been to.
Both project and team have been well received. While we are going to continue
being part of various communities around the world we are trying to limit
extensive travel and focus on functionality and partnerships which will
increase Kiwi TCMS eco-system, make the project even more popular and
drive further adoption!</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> extended GitHub integration via
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/">kiwitcms-github-app</a> plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> release the following
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">test automation framework plugins</a>
for Kiwi TCMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/phpunit-plugin/">PHPUnit plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/pytest-plugin/">py.test plugin</a></li>
<li>TestNG plugin</li>
<li>Jenkins plugin</li>
<li>Robot framework plugin</li>
<li>Django plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/2">test-automation-plugins</a> milestone.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> work with our partners from the proprietary and open source worlds.
This is hard to quantify and lots of it doesn't actually depend on the team.
However we are continuing to talk to them regularly. Expect new feedback to
become available under GitHub Issues.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> see what we can do about testing productivity! This has always been
part of our mission but we have not been able to produce anything worth sharing.
We do have ideas in this space but we are generally looking for partnerships and collaborations.
It is very likely that there will not be very much progress on this front
because it is hard to define it properly :-(.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>At the end of the day most of these goals compliment each other and help drive all of
them to completion. Many of the still on-boarding people have expressed desire to
improve their Python &amp; Django skills. Working to resolve issues in the above specific
areas will give them this opportunity! I expect they will show good progress on their respective
tasks so we can write more about them on this blog.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">2019 roadmap</a>.
TL,DR: last year we've made lots of big and visible changes in Kiwi TCMS.
This year less so. Progress has been slower than before and not so much
visible. Community and team is growing. More contributors are welcome.</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p><em>Status: small progress, needs help</em></p>
<p><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> progress is:</p>
<ul>
<li>-60 code smells</li>
<li>-55 duplications</li>
<li>-50 other issues</li>
<li>4.4% technical debt improvement</li>
<li>-240 hrs remaining until issues are fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>The trend is showing less issues remaining
but it has been a slow progress. As we fix the easier items the remaining ones
become harder to deal with.</p>
<p>We've done minor work related to fixing issues reported by pylint. Around
150 of them still remain!</p>
<p>We have not done any targeted work to resolve other issues reported by Scrutinizer,
remove vendored-in JavaScript libraries, JavaScript refactoring or
classification of issues in 3rd party dependencies.</p>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: 60% done, needs help</em></p>
<p>There are 22 HTML templates remaining to be redesigned (from 59). That's mostly
due to internal cleanup and some refactoring! Test plan and Test run pages are the
two major templates that still need to be redesigned with Patternfly.</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting aka Telemetry</h2>
<p><em>Status: 60% done, in progress, behind schedule</em></p>
<p>The specs for the new <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry</a> system
have been defined after taking into account feedback on GitHub issues. Anton Sankov is
the leading developer for this feature. So far we have 4 telemetry reports merged:
testing break-down, status matrix, execution trends and flaky tests.</p>
<p>There are lots of minor issues or missing functionality in these first iterations
(compared to specification). Work continues on the other telemetry use-cases
and related items.</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p><em>Status: good, needs help</em></p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em> no change in last 6 months.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see plugins for more test automation frameworks
and/or file formats please checkout the
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automation-frameworks.html">documentation</a>
for links and more info.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: 66% complete, in progress, behind schedule</em></p>
<p>We've been making slow progress on this milestone lately. For more info
see
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1</a></p>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: done, awaiting deployment</em></p>
<p>Our team spent some time making Kiwi TCMS the first open source TCMS available
on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms">GitHub Marketplace</a>. At the end
of this year we were able to create a small application that allows further
integration and extending the testing workflow to the GitHub platform.</p>
<p>This is waiting on a few more clarifications from GitHub before we deploy but
for now it can be considered as done. Future functionality will be tracked

<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress, will drop</em></p>
<p>This will be dropped from roadmap for the next year until we can get more interest
from the community.</p>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Looking for external help here. This will stay as a low priority item on our
roadmap for 2020 until we can free more resources on the team.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><em>Status: great, on track, needs work</em></p>
<p>This is our strongest area during this year. We have a strong presence in
multiple communities, our event schedule is very busy and we are gaining more
recognition every day! Core team hit several big bumps this year and is still
recovering with a few more people onboarding.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS suffers from the problem that many of our users can't be contributors
or simply don't want to!</p>
<p>In short: it is important for us to follow our mission and develop our core team
so we can deliver on promises made in our roadmap! That requires a lot of time and
effort which reduces short-term productivity.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">2019 mission and roadmap</a>.
TL,DR: Kiwi TCMS has made progress since January, it's been tough and may not have been
very visible. I feel like we've been behind schedule till now! The greatest
positive thing has been community and team development!</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p><em>Status: minimal progress, needs help</em></p>
<p><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> progress is:</p>
<ul>
<li>-30 code smells</li>
<li>-40 duplications</li>
<li>-30 other issues</li>
<li>4% technical debt improvement</li>
<li>-200 hrs remaining until issues are fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>This is mostly the result of code reviews and minor fixes, not targeted work.</p>
<p>We have not done any targeted work to resolve other issues reported by Scrutinizer,
Pylint, remove vendored-in JavaScript libraries, JavaScript refactoring or
classification of issues in 3rd party dependencies.</p>
<p>There are new people onboarding in the team right now and our plan is for
them to start grinding at these issues very soon!</p>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: 50% done, needs help</em></p>
<p>There are 27 HTML templates remaining to be redesigned (from 59). That's mostly
due to internal cleanup than targeted refactoring. More work on this item
will probably follow towards the end of the year after we get more priority items out of
the way and get more of the new team members rolling!</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting aka Telemetry</h2>
<p><em>Status: in progress, a bit behind schedule</em></p>
<p>The specs for the new <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry</a> system
have been defined after taking into account feedback on GitHub issues. Anton Sankov is
the leading developer for this feature. So far we have 2 telemetry reports merged:
testing break-down and status matrix. The next one will be execution trends.</p>
<p>There are lots of minor issues or missing functionality in these first iterations
(compared to specification). Our plan is to have the major use-cases satisfied first
and then work to refine all of the existing telemetry pages.</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p><em>Status: good, needs help</em></p>
<p>Until now we have released TAP, junit.xml and native JUnit 5 plugins. There's also
a PHPUnit plugin which is more or less complete but unreleased yet. Both JUnit 5
and PHPUnit plugins are developed by external contributors!</p>
<p>We often get asked for plugins for languages and frameworks we don't use or don't
even know! Given that our expertise is mostly in Python we will gladly accept your
pull requests if you decide to maintain or contribute to one of the plugins. This
will also help us get insight into what automation frameworks people are using
and how exactly you structure a test automation workflow around Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<p>Checkout the
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html">documentation</a> for links
and more info.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Last week, right after OpenExpo, we did a check-up session and this was one of the
areas identified with zero amount of progress. I have a strong preference to work
on this feature myself but have not been able to due to various other items that
need my attention.</p>
<p>The short version is that I'd prefer to remove all issue tracker specific code
and allow the tester to add arbitrary URLs to link to existing bugs. How to do
integration (even as simple as publishing a comment in the bug tracker) over
a generic interface still eludes me. In the next few weeks I will kick-off this
topic with a separate blog post/issue for everyone to comment on.</p>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Our team spent some time making Kiwi TCMS the first open source TCMS available
on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms">GitHub Marketplace</a>. We will
continue this integration effort and flow integration will emerge from that.
There's also many things that need to be done to satisfy GitHub's .</p>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Our mission is to transform testing in your organization by providing
the tools for that via Kiwi TCMS. It is astonishing that so far nobody has provided
any kind of feedback in <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/703">Issue #703</a>
wrt improving productivity in their teams!</p>
<p>We have some ideas which have been blocked by lack of resources on the team and
refactoring tasks. Because we've adopted this as our mission this is an important
item for us and we'll continue working on it as resources allow.
Progress is to be expected towards the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><em>Status: great, on track, needs work</em></p>
<p>This is our strongest area during the year so far. We have a strong presence in
several communities, our event schedule is busy enough and we are gaining more
recognition every day!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted project stand at 3/5 conferences with 2 more on-track</li>
<li>Won the OpenAward for <a href="2019-06-24-openawards-winner.markdown">Best Tech Community</a></li>
<li>Hosted several presentations and workshops with few more on track</li>
<li>Found new talent to join the core team: 2 just ready to start contributing, 5 more in training</li>
<li>1 more senior engineer as a mentor. We also have a few independent wanna-be contributors
  and will be hosting qualification interviews for marketing assistant very soon</li>
<li>There are contributions and pull requests coming from users of Kiwi TCMS as well.
  We'd like to see more of course.</li>
<li>There are a couple of open source projects and companies using Kiwi TCMS who
  are friendly towards the project. We are working with them to get a public
  endorsement on the website and engage in more technical work together. Of course
  everyone has limited resources and is very busy :-(</li>
<li>Sponsors on <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms#contributors">OpenCollect</a> are just
  a few but we didn't have any previously so this is a good sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the moment to mention that not all is honey and roses in open source land.
Kiwi TCMS suffers from the problem that many of our users can't be contributors
or simply don't want to!</p>
<p>Manual testers can't program. This is a fact and a good sized chunk of our user base
actually performs manual testing. Those that can write automation and probably
code decently well may not be familiar with Python and Django. At least in Bulgaria
these two aren't very popular, definitely not among testers. That is to say this part
of the user-base simply doesn't have the necessary skills to contribute and the majority
of what we need is code contribution!</p>
<p>Another (fairly big IMO) group of users are coming from proprietary companies who
view open source and Kiwi TCMS as a zero cost option. Something that they take free
of charge and use it without ever contributing back. They don't understand nor really
care about the open source culture.</p>
<p>To make things worse we receive requests every single day via
our private email addresses or questions via IM despite our website clearly stating
community engagement rules. On a few occasions we have received very rude comments
of the sort "our company demands you fix this", "is this going to be ready this year"
(context implying entitlement), etc. To make things more ridiculous we've even received
support requests (via contact form) from companies and start-up
who get their return address wrong so we can't get in touch directly!</p>
<p>In short: don't demand anything from us unless you are ready to pay for it, work for it
yourself or propose a mutually beneficial scenario. We do try to keep the community
happy but more importantly follow our mission and develop our core team!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers, Kiwi TCMS has taken on a brave new
mission! We would like to transform the testing process by making it more
organized, transparent &amp; accountable for everyone on your team. Our goal
is to improve engineering productivity and participation in
testing. The following blog post outlines how we would like to achieve
this and what goals we put before ourselves for this year.</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p>Last year we took on the challenge to bring a legacy code base up to modern
coding standard. We did not complete that effort but made very good progress
along the way. This is not a small task and that's why our team will continue
with it this year.</p>
<p><img src="/images/codeclimate_jan_2019.png" style="float:none"
     alt="CodeClimate report" title="CodeClimate report"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a>:
  0 issues, 0% technical debt, health score A</li>
<li><a href="https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/kiwitcms/Kiwi/">Scrutinizer</a>:
  only A and B type issues</li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/475946313">Pylint</a>: 0 issues</li>
<li>Remove vendored-in Handlebars, jQuery, jQuery-UI and TableDnD JavaScript
  libraries in favor of existing npm dependencies</li>
<li>Front-end uses the existing JSON-RPC instead of backend views that
  are only used for AJAX requests. Tip: these are usually accessed via
  <code>postToURL()</code> and <code>jQ.ajax()</code> on the front-end</li>
<li>Inspect and classify all 3rd party issues reported from
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/kiwitcms-kiwi">Coverity</a> and
  <a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/475946312">Bandit</a>. Report and fix
  what we can, ignore the rest that do not affect Kiwi TCMS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p>There are 59 templates remaining to be converted to a modern look and feel.
Along with them comes more refactoring and even redesign of the existing pages
and the workflow around them. Together with refactoring this will make Kiwi TCMS
easier to use and also to maintain.</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting</h2>
<p>We are planning to remove the existing reports feature because they are not well
designed. We will re-implement existing functionality that our community finds useful,
add new types of reports (incl. nicer graphics and UI) and make it possible for the
reporting sub-system to be more easily extendable.</p>
<p>Phase out is planned to begin after 1st March 2019! Until then we are looking for your
feedback. Please comment in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/657">Issue #657</a>!</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p>These will make it easier to collect results from automated test suites into
Kiwi TCMS for later analysis. Instead of creating scripts that parse the
results and talk to our API you will only have to install an additional package
in your test environment and configure the test runner to use it! Automation
test results will then appear inside Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin">JUnit 5 plugin</a> - already in progress</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/692">TestNG plugin</a> - RFC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/693">Django plugin</a> - RFC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/694">py.test plugin</a> - RFC</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to use such functionality leave your vote inside GitHub
issues! In case you would like to write a test-runner plugin you can find the
specification
<a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/2018/11/05/test-runner-plugin-specification/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: Does Kiwi TCMS integrate with JIRA?</p>
<p>Answer: Well, it does. How exactly do you want to integrate?</p>
<p>... silence ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following dialog happens every time someone asks me about bug-tracker
integration, especially with JIRA. The thing is integration is a specified
set of behavior which may or may not be desired in a particular team. As of now
Kiwi TCMS is able to open a URL to your bug-tracker with predefined field
values, add comments to bug reports and report a simple summary of bugs
inside a TestRun.</p>
<p>We recognize this may not be enough and together with the community we
really need to define what bug tracker integration means! The broader domain
of application lifecycle management tools (of which TCMS is a sub-set) have an
integrated bug tracking system. We can add something like this and save you
the trouble of using JIRA, however many teams have already invested in
integrating their infrastructure or just like other tools. For example we love
GitHub issues and our team regularly makes public reports about issues that
we find internally!</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/698">Issue #698</a></li>
<li>Goal: Bug-tracker functionality inside Kiwi TCMS, similar to
  GitHub Issues. Vote in

  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/530">Issue #530</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p>Developers have their
<a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub PR flow</a> and if they
have done the job of having unit tests then they will merge only when things
are green! This leaves additional testing efforts kind of to the side and
doesn't really help with transparency and visibility. I'm not going to mention
having an automatically deployed staging environment for every change
because very few teams actually have managed to do this effectively.</p>
<p><img src="/images/github_kiwitcms_pr_status.png" style="float:none"
     alt="Kiwi TCMS statuses on GitHub PR" title="Kiwi TCMS statuses on GitHub PR"></p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Figure out how Kiwi TCMS can integrate with GitHub flow and bridge the gap.
  Please share and <code>+1</code> your wildest ideas in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/700">Issue #700</a>.</li>
<li>Follow up: depending on the results in #700 we will follow with other goals and
  sub-tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p>Speaking of modern engineering flow is your team truly agile? When and how
do you plan your testing activities ? Before the devel sprint or afterwards?
How many testers take part in refining product backlog and working on user stories?</p>
<p>Similar to GitHub flow lots of teams and open source projects are using Trello
to effectively organize their development process. Testing should not be left
behind and Kiwi TCMS may be able to help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Figure out how Kiwi TCMS fits into the overall <code>devel-test-planning</code>
  process for agile teams and what we can do to make this easier for testers.
  Please share and <code>+1</code> your wildest ideas in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/701">Issue #701</a></li>
<li>Follow up: depending on the results in #701 we will follow with other goals and
  sub-tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p>What makes a test engineer productive when they need to assess product risk and
new features, when mapping product requirements documents (PRD) to test plans and
test cases, when collaborating on user stories and behavior specification ?
What makes developers, product owners, designers and other professionals productive
when it comes to dealing with testing ?</p>
<p>For example consider the following workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company has idea for a new product</li>
<li>In case this is a big product it may have its own mission, i.e. what kind
  of problem is it trying to solve and for which group of customers</li>
<li>Product backlog is then created which outlines features that map
  to the product mission</li>
<li>Then the team, together with test engineers perform example mapping
  and discuss and refine the initial feature requirements. User stories
  are created</li>
<li>Behavior specification may also be created</li>
<li>Test plans and test cases are the immediate product of BDD specs and
  desired user stories</li>
</ul>
<p>Later we iterate through the sprints and for each sprint something like
this happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desired product features are planned for development. They must be <em>complete</em>
  at least in terms of requirements, specs and tests</li>
<li>Devel writes code, maybe some unit tests, testers can also write automated tests
  and/or manually verify the current state of the feature being developed</li>
<li>Testing, including exploratory is performed before feature is merged</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>Devel is also part of testing, right? Product owners, UX and interaction
designers as well. Producing quality software product is a team effort!</p>
<p>In every step of the way Kiwi TCMS can provide notification wizards, guidelines
and/or documentation for best practices, facilitate tooling, e.g. to write user stories
and assess them or map out an exploratory testing session, etc. The list
of ideas is virtually endless. We can even go into deep learning, AI and
blockchain but honestly who knows how to use them in testing ?</p>
<p>Our team is not quite sure how this goal will look like 3 months from now
but we are certain that testing needs to happen first, last and all the time
during the entire software development lifecycle. By providing the necessary
functionality and tools in Kiwi TCMS we can boost engineering productivity
and steer the testing process in your organization into a better, more productive
direction which welcomes participation from all engineering groups.</p>
<p>Let's consider another point of view: testing is a creative activity
which is benefited by putting your brain into a specific state of mind!
For example Gherkin (the Given-When-Then language) has the benefit of
forcing you to think about behavior and while doing so you are vocalizing
the various roles in the system, what kind of actions are accepted and
what sort of result is expected! Many times this will help you remember or
discover missing scenarios, edge cases and raise even more questions!</p>
<p>Crazy ideas, brain dumps and <code>+1</code> as always are welcome in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/703">Issue #703</a>.</p>

  We will be happy to publish them on our website</li>
<li>Send us a pull request on GitHub</li>
<li><a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">Become a sponsor</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also looking to expand our core team and the list of occasional
contributors. The following are mostly organizational goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: participate in 5 conferences with a project stand</li>
<li>Goal: define how we find, recruit and onboard new team members. The
  foundation is already set in
  <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/3/kiwi-tcms-team-onboarding#testcases">TP-3</a></li>
<li>Goal: clearly mark GitHub issues which are suitable for external contributors
  which don’t want to spend lots of time learning how Kiwi TCMS works under the hood.
  We're going to tag all such issues with the
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/labels/help%20wanted">
    <img src="/images/github_helpwanted.png" style="float: none; margin:0"
         alt="GitHub help wanted" title="GitHub help wanted">
  </a> label</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development policy</h2>
<p>Our team will be working on areas related to the goals above. A <code>+1</code>
reaction on GitHub issues will help us prioritize what we work on!</p>
<p><img src="/images/github_plus_one.png" style="float:none"
     alt="GitHub +1" title="GitHub +1"></p>
<p>Bug fixes and other
issues will be occasionally slipped into the stream and pull requests from
non-team contributors will be reviewed and merged in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>There is at least 1 full day of work that goes behind the scenes when
a new version is officially released: compile changelog, build images and
upload them, create blog post and newsletter announcement, share on social
media, etc. We also deploy on our own Kiwi TCMS instance as a stop-gap
measure before making everything public!</p>
<p>New PyPI tarballs and Docker images will be released every few weeks as
we see fit, this has been our standard process. We try to align releases
with Django's release schedule and try to cut a new version when there are known
security vulnerabilities fixed. However we can't guarantee this will always
be the case!</p>
<p>If you are in a hurry and need something quickly the best option is to
send a pull request, build your own Docker image from source and
maybe consider
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">sponsoring us via Open Collective</a>!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals in our 2018
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>
(<a href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/25/mid-year-roadmap-status-report/">mid-year update here</a>).
TLDR; goals are completed at 62%. Refactoring legacy code is showing good results,
less so on the front-end side and there are items still in progress!</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> reported
a "D" rating with 600+ code smells and 600+ duplications and a 1 year estimation
to resolve these. We're now down to "C" rating with 171 smells and 203 duplications.</p>
<p>The level of technical debt has dropped from 32.5% down to 17.7% and we have removed
around 14000 lines of Python code and 8000 lines of JavaScript code without
losing significant functionality.</p>
<p>Checkout
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/trends/technical_debt">the stats</a>
for more info!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p><em>Status: almost finished</em></p>
<p>Both pylint and pylint-django have been integrated into our CI workflow. There are even
some custom built plugins that we use. The number of issues reported is down to 100
from 4000+ initially. These are predominantly <code>fixme</code> comments which are also in parts
of the code that are scheduled for removal and refactoring.</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Several views were modified to return pure JSON but we've not
done any targeted work to resolve this issue. A number of other views have been
removed in favor of using the existing JSON-RPC layer.</p>
<p>This is an internal refactoring effort which isn't very visible from the outside.
This is also one of the factors contributing to the high number of removed
source code.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Not much has been done in this area except the occasional refactoring to
JSON-RPC.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p><em>Status: complete</em></p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress, dropped</em></p>
<p>All RPC methods have been documented! The rest of the internals will be documented
as we go along.</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We still carry around jQuery, jQuery-UI and Handlebars.js. They will be
removed once the pages using them are converted to use the Patternfly widgets
library.</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>There are still over 50 HTML templates in <code>tcms/templates/</code> that need to be
refactored into Patternfly. We've been working on them one at a time and will
focus more on this effort in the next couple of months.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Some of the pages have been converted to use Patternfly. The most important pages
that still have a different look and feel are TestPlan view, TestCase view and
TestRun view. These are also the hardest to convert because they have lots of
tabs/components which pull information from various places. Our goal is to create
reusable widgets for the various components (e.g. a list of TestCases) and then
include these components into several different templates to minimize code
duplication.</p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>A number of JavaScript functions have been refactored and removed during the
past few releases but there are still thousands of lines of code left to deal with.
This effort is mostly happening in parallel with the Patternfly redesign.
We still don't have anything to test front-end JavaScript functionality!</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We are seeing a steady stream of new users registered on
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> and
there are several active contributors on GitHub. Most of our translators are
very active and keep their respective languages fresh and up to date!</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS was represented at OSCAL Tirana, DjangoCon Heidelberg, PyCon Prague,
HackConf Sofia, PiterPy St. Petersburg and OpenFest Sofia. We've also been
approved for a project stand at FOSDEM 2019 so watch this blog for more news.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>.</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> reported
a "D" rating with a 1 year estimated effort. Now it is still on "D" rating with
a 7 months estimated effort to bring the project back in shape.
Code smells have dropped from 600+ to 418, duplications have been reduced from 600+ to 359!
At the same time technical debt ratio has been decreased from 32,5% to 21,6% and
little over 10000 lines of code have been removed from the source code.

<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/trends/technical_debt">the stats</a>
for more info!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>Both pylint and pylint-django have been integrated into our CI workflow. There are even
a few custom built plugins that we use. The number of issues reported is down to around 900
from 4000+ initially. The cleanup has been lead by <a href="https://github.com/asankov">Anton Sankov</a>
with help from <a href="https://github.com/ivo0126">Ivaylo Ivanov</a> and myself.</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Several views were probably modified to return pure JSON in the meantime but we've not
done any targeted work to resolve this issue.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Same as above, not much has been done in this area.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p><em>Status: complete</em></p>
<p>After Kiwi TCMS v4.0 the server side API has been reorganized and updated
to follow the model/method names used internally.</p>
<p>After the recent version 5.0 the client side API library has been stripped
to its most basic form so that you can work directly with the responses from
the server.</p>
<p>There is no more duplication and ambiguity in names because there isn't
a lot of code left!</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress, dropped</em></p>
<p>All RPC methods have been documented! The rest of the internals will be documented
as we go along.</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Several JavaScript libraries have been removed but we still carry around jQuery
and Handlebars.js. No work has been done to convert Kiwi TCMS to use the jQuery
version provided with Django.</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p><em>Status: minimal progress</em></p>
<p>There are still over 100 HTML templates in Kiwi TCMS. Some of the HTML templates
have been merged together, some email templates have been refactored and marked
as translatable but the majority of them have not been updated for a long time.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p><em>Status: small progress</em></p>
<p>A number of JavaScript functions have been refactored and removed during the
past few releases but there are still thousands of lines of code left to deal with.</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>We are seeing a steady stream of new users registered on
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> and
there are several active contributors (issues, translations).</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS was represented at OSCAL Tirana, DjangoCon Heidelberg and PyCon Prague!
We're planning to attend HackConf and OpenFest in Sofia by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

                on Mon 22 January 2018
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone. As you know Kiwi TCMS has been around for a while and it has
gone through some big changes in the last year! It started as an abandoned
Django 1.6 project with broken test suite and is now currently running on the
latest Django 2.0.1 with Python 3.5! It is clearly a legacy code base!</p>
<p>We, the Kiwi TCMS team, have learned a lot more about the project and this
blog post describes our roadmap for 2018 in terms of technical work and community
engagement. The general technical direction is cleaner/simpler code,
improved UI/UX and more tests!</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p>The current code is a bunch of very large modules and functions and classes
bundled together. It is also old and sometimes looks like spaghetti code.
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> gives us a "D" rating
for maintainability with a 1 year estimated effort to fix that. There are 600+
code smells and 600+ duplications detected by CodeClimate. Our goal is to get this
number down to zero!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p>pylint is the standard static analyzer for Python and currently it reports over
4000 errors and warnings when executed against Kiwi TCMS. This is a huge number and
it needs to become zero! We've also identified interesting patterns that will
make it into pylint and pylint-django plugins!</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p>The current state of affairs is a mix and match of everything. There are views that
render HTML, others which return pure JSON, other which return HTML encoded as JSON string
and probably everything in between. Views that render pages need to do just that
and views that are used with AJAX calls from the UI need to return pure JSON!
A lot of these are hiding in plain sight and will come to light when we start
overhauling the user interface.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p>There are lots of forms in Kiwi TCMS. Sometimes they are submitted by the user and
other times they are serialized and POSTed by some JavaScript code. This isn't
very easy to understand plus this entire home-grown utility code doesn't bring
anything useful to the project. All of these need to be identified and cleaned up.
JavaScript code needs to send or consume JSON, nothing else!</p>
<p>There are also lots of places where Kiwi issues GET requests with a number of
query parameters. Our goal is to minimize these and where possible have the
parameters as part of the Django urls scheme, not as query strings.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p>The current API module is a bit disorganized. API namespaces don't match the
names of the underlying DB models and the API client classes don't match any
of the other two! The way we pass parameters and what these parameters are
named should match between the client, the RPC method and the underlying model!</p>
<p>In earlier releases we've removed duplicate or similar RPC methods and we
think there are more of these that need our love.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>We've started producing documentation from doc-strings and most of the RPC
methods have such. However it is unformatted and barely readable, sometimes
even inaccurate. Previous releases made progress on this but there's a lot
more to cover.</p>
<p>All RPC methods should be documented first and then the rest of Kiwi's
internals to make development easier!</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p>There are 11 vendored-in JavaScript files that we carry around in Kiwi TCMS.
Most notable are jQuery plus a few addons and Handlebars.js. To the extent possible
our goal is to use jQuery provided by Django or installed via NPM dependencies!</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p>There are over 100 HTML templates in Kiwi TCMS. There are also email and even
JavaScript templates. For example there are <code>get_cases.html</code> and <code>get_review_cases.html</code>
which are essentially the same. This is kind of also true for templates used in
new and edit views! Such templates should be unified!</p>
<p>Those JavaScript templates need to be totally gone!</p>
<p>All templates are stuffed together in a single directory and their names
are not very predictable. They need to be split per application and follow
some kind of naming convention.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p>The UI already uses the Patternfly library for some of its widgets. Most notably
the main navigation header. Our goal is for the entire UI to be ported to Patternfly
by updating widgets HTML and CSS where needed.
This will also help clean things up a lot. At the same time we'll be rethinking how
information is organized on screen and how the person interacts with it! Usability
suggestions are very welcome!</p>
<p>This move will also help us get rid of the Handlebars dependency which is now
used for pop-up dialogs.</p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p>There's lots of JavaScript code on the front-end and honestly we don't quite know
what it does or how it is organized. There are also no tests on the front-end
whatsoever!</p>
<p>It is our goal for this to change with the intention to not overdo the JavaScript
part and keep things very minimal. At the moment we're thinking about vanilla jQuery
that will act as a proxy between the browser and the back-end!</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p>A year ago hardly anybody knew what Kiwi TCMS was, the project didn't even have
this name, there was 1 active contributor and hardly any users! Now the community
has started to slowly revitalize, we're seeing some contributions from our
junior team members (more on this in another blog post) and also seeing
folks installing and using Kiwi TCMS and reporting interesting bugs and feature
requests around it!</p>
<p>For the upcoming year our goal is to seek active engagement with other open source
projects that could make use of Kiwi TCMS and work with them. Kudos to
openSUSE for being the first
<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/95">to propose such integration</a>!
We're also planning couple of appearances at a few conferences but there's
nothing confirmed yet.</p>
<p>Every other contribution in terms of bug reports, new users and feature requests
is of course welcome but we're very conscious of the fact that there's tons
of work to be done and the team is still very small!</p>
<p>Team wise we'd like to get the existing team members up to speed and tackle
the above tasks with priority. This will also help us introduce bug fixes
and new features more quickly!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
