<p>Attention testers! On behalf of the
<a href="https://fosdem-testingautomation.github.io/"><em>Testing and Continuous Delivery devroom</em></a>
we'd like to announce that call for participation is now open.
This room is about building better software through a focus on testing and
continuous delivery practices across all layers of the stack.
The purpose of this devroom is to share good and bad examples around the question
‚Äúhow to improve quality of our software by automating tests, deliveries or deployments‚Äù
and to showcase new open source tools and practices.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> for FOSDEM 2026 this devroom is a merger between the former
<em>Testing and Automation</em> and <em>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</em> devrooms and
is jointly organized between devroom managers in previous FOSDEM editions!
Kiwi TCMS is proud to be part of the team hosting this devroom!</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> devroom will take place on Sunday, February 1st 2026 at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/practical/transportation/">ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium</a>!
Presentations will be streamed online but all accepted speakers are required to deliver
their talks in person!</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for topics that are a good fit for this devroom:</p>
<p>Testing in the real, open source world</p>
<ul>
<li>War stories/strategies for testing large scale or complex projects</li>
<li>Tools that extend the ability to test low-level code, e.g. bootloaders, init systems, etc.</li>
<li>Projects that are introducing new/interesting ways of testing "systems"</li>
<li>Address the automated testing frameworks fragmentation</li>
<li>Stories from end-users (e.g. success/failure)</li>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Continuous Deployment</li>
<li>Security in Software Supply Chain</li>
<li>Pipeline standardization</li>
<li>Interoperability in CI/CD</li>
<li>Lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)</p>
<ul>
<li>Project showcases, modern tooling</li>
<li>How your open source tool made developing quality software better</li>
<li>What tools do you use to setup your CI/CD</li>
<li>Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things
  "Not enough people in the open source community know how to use $X,
  but here's a tutorial on how to use $X to make your project better."</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past the devroom has seen both newbies/students and experienced professionals and
past speakers as part of the audience and talks covering from beginner/practical
to advanced/abstract topics. If you have doubts then submit your proposal and
leave a comment for the devroom managers and we'll get back to you.</p>
<p>To submit a talk proposal (you can submit multiple proposals if you'd like) use
<a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/">Pretalx</a>, the FOSDEM paper submission system.
Be sure to select <em>Testing and Continuous delivery</em> otherwise we won't see your
proposal!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
this page explains what the <em>Enterprise</em> subscription is and how it brings more
value beyond the Kiwi TCMS application itself.
Please read about the details below.</p>
<h2>What is Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</h2>
<p>This is a distribution of the Kiwi TCMS application with multiple add-ons
suitable for enterprise customers. Popular examples include various login
backends, e.g. LDAP and multi-tenancy architecture. See the
<a href="{filename}../pages/features.html">features page</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Who is this subscription for</h2>
<p><em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> is suitable for medium to large organizations which would
like to have full control over their Kiwi TCMS instance and most likely integrate
it with existing 3rd party systems.
These are typically organizations with hundreds or thousands of testers with strong
internal DevOps team and sizable existing infrastructure.</p>
<h2>What do you get</h2>
<p>Everything from lower tier subscription plans!</p>
<p>Most notably you get access to all versions of community &amp; enterprise containers
as well as a SaaS namespace plus extended support.</p>
<p>The SaaS namespace can be used as a sandbox for in-house development and
backwards compatibility testing against the latest version of Kiwi TCMS before
upgrading your internal production instance!</p>
<h2>What do all of the individual items mean</h2>
<p><strong>On-premises inside your VPN:</strong> your DevOps team is responsible for provisioning Kiwi TCMS
and keeping it up and running. Typically this would happen inside your company's VPN and would
be accessible only to employees.
It is an on-premises installation which you have full control over.</p>
<p>NOTICE: This subscription price is per instance! For multiple installations of Kiwi TCMS
please adjust the quantity of items on your subscription!</p>
<p><strong>Tagged releases and multi-arch builds:</strong> as part of the <em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> subscription
you get access to <a href="/containers/">private container repositories</a> with
version tagged builds for <code>aarch64</code> and <code>x86_64</code> CPU architectures. This gives you more hosting options and makes
it easier to upgrade to new versions when you decide to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Unlimited tenants:</strong> a <em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> container is multi-tenant, meaning that
you can organize testing work into multiple namespaces. For example <code>product-1.tcms.example.com</code>,
<code>team-2.tcms.example.com</code>, <code>abcd.tcms.example.com</code> and so on. There is no limit on the number
of tenants you can have, nor the number of users who can have access to each tenant. That is
entirely up to your teams to decide.</p>
<p><strong>Full Admin panel access:</strong> means that as part of a <em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> installation you would
designate one or more user accounts as your Kiwi TCMS administrators. They will have full access
to the built-in admin pages of the application and be able to perform actions such as creating or disabling
other accounts, assigning permissions, creating tenants, etc.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS refers to such accounts as super-user and the first created account receives super-user
status by default.</p>
<p>NOTICE: super-user / admin accounts are meant for day-to-day operations via the web interface while
a DevOps team will have terminal access to the Kiwi TCMS application for routine maintenance or
one-off tasks. In many cases these roles are performed by the same engineer but don't need to be.</p>
<p><strong>Based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux:</strong> with a <em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> subscription you receive
an explicit guarantee that the underlying container image is built on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
There is no such guarantee for other container images produced by the Kiwi TCMS team!</p>
<p><strong>Multiple add-ons:</strong> a <em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> container image ships more functionality than the
community edition of Kiwi TCMS. Our focus is to provide better operational experience for seasoned
IT teams and make it easier to integrate Kiwi TCMS with existing infrastructure and 3rd party systems.
Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>OAuth (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) login, LDAP or kerberos</li>
<li>Metrics and error logging</li>
<li>Let's Encrypt SSL certificates</li>
<li>Flexible NGINX configuration</li>
<li>Amazon SES integration</li>
<li>Various storage backends</li>
<li>Additional integration with less popular bug-tracking systems</li>
</ul>
<p>This list changes over time however we are fully committed to everything being open source!</p>
<p><strong>Extended support:</strong> as part of <em>Kiwi TCMS Enterprise</em> subscription you get more support coverage,
<em>08-20 UTC/Mon-Fri</em> with a guaranteed response within <em>24 hrs</em>. This is 6 hours extra coverage
compared to lower tier subscription plans.</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

            <p>Hello testers, this page explains what the <em>Private Tenant</em> subscription is and
how it brings more value beyond the Kiwi TCMS application itself.
Please read about the details below.</p>
<h2>What is Private Tenant by Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>This is our most popular subscription tier which combines SaaS hosting and
additional support services. It is more about <em>ease of use</em> allowing your
QA team to focus on more testing rather than specific software features.</p>
<h2>Who is this subscription for</h2>
<p><em>Private Tenant</em> is suitable for medium sized teams which consider
their Kiwi TCMS instance to be an important piece of infrastructure but
not necessarily mission critical.
These are organizations with less than 100 testers
which would like to focus their limited resources towards their own
products and are happy to consume 3rd party software as a service.
Most typically these are start-up companies and medium sized businesses.</p>
<h2>What do you get</h2>
<p>Everything from lower tier subscription plans!</p>
<p>Most notably you get access to all versions of community releases and a
dedicated SaaS namespace as your main Kiwi TCMS instance plus extra
product features and technical support.</p>
<h2>What do all of the individual items mean</h2>
<p><strong>1x SaaS hosting:</strong> you will receive the opportunity to create your own namespace
under the <code>tenant.kiwitcms.org</code> domain name, for example <code>https://acme-inc.tenant.kiwitcms.org</code>.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: A <em>Private Tenant</em> subscription entitles you to a single namespace and the email associated
with the purchase is referred to as <em>tenant owner</em>.
If you need more tenants you should purchase additional subscriptions under different email addresses!</p>
<p><strong>Unlimited users:</strong> means exactly that - you may assign an arbitrary number of users to have access
to the information kept under your tenant. With <em>Private Tenant</em> subscription there are no per-seat
fees - it is a flat rate price!</p>
<p><strong>Control of authorized users:</strong> means that you can control who has access to your data and adjust
their permissions level when necessary. You can have your QA team and your partners collaborate in a
single Kiwi TCMS tenant if you decide to do so.</p>
<p>With a <em>Private Tenant</em> subscription user accounts are actually kept under <code>public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</code>,
which is also referred to as <em>the main tenant</em> or <em>the public tenant</em> while access control is granted on
a per-tenant basis via the web interface by the tenant owner.</p>
<p>NOTICE: the name "public tenant" is a misnomer, which comes from one of the underlying programming
libraries used inside Kiwi TCMS. In reality no data is publicly visible, including user accounts.</p>
<p><strong>No User account admin:</strong> a stand-alone installation of Kiwi TCMS allows the first registered account,
named super-user, to have access to all others. This isn't the case with a <em>Private Tenant</em> subscription.
You may invite/authorize users and groups for your own tenant and manage access permissions however
you cannot create, remove or disable user accounts. You cannot view the list of all other accounts
which exist in the database.</p>
<p><strong>Extra functionality:</strong> a <em>Private Tenant</em> subscription is actually built on top of a
Kiwi TCMS Enterprise container image which means some extra features and add-ons are available
to you as part of this subscription. Whenever possible add-on features are also accessible to
<em>Private Tenant</em> subscribers. A notable exception are different login methods which cannot be
enabled nor configured on a per-tenant basis!</p>
<p><strong>Always the latest version:</strong> a SaaS tenant is always the latest version and is automatically
upgraded by the Kiwi TCMS team. While we try our best not to introduce bugs and backwards incompatible
changes it is possible that test automation scripts and/or 3rd party integration code may break
sometimes.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: With a <em>Private Tenant</em> subscription the responsibility of testing all of your integrations against
the latest version of Kiwi TCMS falls onto the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Backup &amp; disaster recovery:</strong> the Kiwi TCMS team takes care to backup our SaaS cluster regularly
in case a catastrophic failure occurs - this is designed for disaster recovery purposes.</p>
<p>While the Kiwi TCMS application itself keeps track of changes and removals of certain objects it may
not always be possible to restore a deleted entry. You may be able to create new records with
the same information however if a record cannot be restored via the Kiwi TCMS web interface we cannot help you.
Due to technical limitations we cannot restore individual records from a <em>Private Tenant</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Data access via web &amp; API:</strong> keeping in mind that a <em>Private Tenant</em> namespace is allocated
on a cluster with hundreds of others your only access to data is via web and API.
Due to technical and security limitations we cannot give you access to the underlying database nor
the raw backup files. You are free to export your data as frequently as you wish though!</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated technical support:</strong> as a <em>Private Tenant</em> customer you receive full technical support
from the Kiwi TCMS team spanning all components related to the Kiwi TCMS application. Working hours
and response times are listed on our main page!</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

                on Wed 20 August 2025
            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
this page explains what the <em>Self Support</em> subscription is
and how it brings a bit more value beyond the Kiwi TCMS application itself.
You can read about the details below.</p>
<h2>What is Self Support by Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>This is our lowest-tier of support services, where the majority of the work
falls onto the customer to host and run the Kiwi TCMS application.
It is an entry-level subscription which provides the basis for
all other subscriptions.</p>
<h2>Who is this subscription for</h2>
<p><em>Self Support</em> is suitable for very small teams and individual engineers
where their Kiwi TCMS instance is not a mission critical piece of infrastructure -
perhaps an instance which is rarely used and isn't available 24/7, a development target
or an initial proof of concept installation.</p>
<p>These are typically organizations with less than 10 testers
which have no particular requirements other than being able to record and inspect
test execution results.</p>
<h2>What do you get</h2>
<p>This subscription entitles you to a few more items on top of the regular
<em>community edition</em> version of Kiwi TCMS. Please read for the details below.</p>
<h2>What do all of the individual items mean</h2>
<p><strong>Self-hosted on your server:</strong> you will be responsible for installing, configuring
and managing your Kiwi TCMS instance. Backups, upgrades, etc. are entirely a
responsibility of your own.</p>
<p>NOTICE: We kindly ask you to adjust the quantity of items on the subscription in case you are running
multiple instances of Kiwi TCMS!</p>
<p><strong>Tagged releases and multi-arch builds:</strong> regular <em>community edition</em> of Kiwi TCMS provides
only a <code>latest</code> version for the <code>x86_64</code> processor architecture.</p>
<p>As part of the <em>Self Support</em> subscription you get access to a private container repository
called <a href="/containers/">kiwitcms/version</a> with version tagged builds
for <code>aarch64</code> and <code>x86_64</code> CPU architectures. This gives you more hosting options and makes
it easier to upgrade to new versions when you decide to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Limited support:</strong> <em>Self Support</em> customers do not receive technical support. Help from the
Kiwi TCMS team is limited to account and billing issues and response times are not guaranteed!</p>
<p><strong>Price freeze:</strong> subscription price is usually updated once a year to account for inflation
and any additional services which may be provided under a particular subscription tier.
Customers with an active subscription are protected from these changes - price stays fixed
as long as your subscription is active! You will get full access to any new services as soon as
they are implemented.</p>
<p><strong>No ads:</strong> regular <em>community edition</em> version of Kiwi TCMS comes with built-in advertisement
from <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/">EthicalAds</a> rewards from which are paid out to
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/transactions">opencollective.com/kiwitcms</a> for transparency.</p>
<p>Container images from the <em>Self Support</em> subscription remove those ads and make the web
interface cleaner.</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p><img alt="&quot;AMI + Kiwi TCMS logos&quot;" src="/images/customers/ami+kiwitcms.png" title="AMI + Kiwi TCMS logos"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ami.com">AMI</a>, is an international company,
reimagining firmware for modern computing, providing secure, manageable solutions
across on-premises, cloud, and edge platforms. Its technology and support drive
innovation and lasting partnerships with top tech brands.</p>
<h3>Tell us more about AMI's product lines</h3>
<p>AMI delivers firmware and management solutions for servers, data centers,
and embedded systems. Key products include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aptio V¬Æ</strong>: A next-gen UEFI/BIOS solution enabling dynamic processor and peripheral
  management for Cloud, Edge, and IoT environments.</li>
<li><strong>MegaRAC¬Æ</strong>: Advanced BMC solutions like SP-X and OneTree for remote, OS-independent
  server management, including power control, KVM redirection, and virtual
  media.</li>
<li><strong>TektagonTM</strong>: A Platform Root of Trust ensuring secure and validated firmware boot
  processes.</li>
<li><strong>AMI¬Æ Data Center Manager (DCM)</strong>: Software for managing multi-vendor data centers,
  offering insights on health, power, thermal performance, and sustainability metrics to
  optimize operations and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>AMI develops products at all levels of the technology hierarchy, starting with low level firmware
to cloud based applications. For boot firmware, it's mostly assembly and C.
For manageability firmware, it's a combination of C, C++, Linux Shell scripting.
Our products have web interfaces so the HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack is also very common.
Python is extensively used as the backend language of choice for cloud applications.</p>
<h3>How about AMI's relation to open source</h3>
<p>AMI has forged a robust partnership with the <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/">Open Compute Project</a>,
driving innovation and collaboration in open source firmware solutions. As one of the key proponents of
open source technologies in this space, AMI integrates
<a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2">EDK2</a> and embedded Linux into firmware solutions.
We are a major sponsor of the Open Compute Project and a key contributor.</p>
<h3>What makes testing at AMI challenging</h3>
<p>At AMI, the Test team plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and excellence of our
product lines. Given the dynamic nature of our projects, the team frequently transitions
between tasks to accommodate multiple ongoing initiatives. This adaptability is crucial in
maintaining rigorous standards across diverse firmware and management solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Test team is committed to delivering valuable insights by analyzing
quality trends and producing detailed reports. These analyses equip leadership with actionable
data, fostering informed decision-making and continuous improvement across all
development efforts.</p>
<p><em>Constantly changing priorities combined with the need to provide accurate
reporting make testing at AMI challenging!</em></p>
<p>Since we are a black box/acceptance test group, our System Under Test are actual hardware platforms.
And since we do boot firmware and manageability firmware solutions, we have to test on
early revision hardware, which is unstable. This makes test automation challenging.
And even for automation, we have to rely on hardware tooling like IP controlled AC power strips,
firmware programming devices and single board computers like Raspberry Pi for controlling various
aspects of the system under test. We also support multiple hardware architectures, 
which increases the breadth of what we need to test.</p>
<h3>How do teams at AMI approach testing? Can you walk us through the process</h3>
<p>Our black-box user acceptance testing (UAT) team ensures end-user expectations align
with product functionality, performance, and usability. Collaborating with developers and
studying standards and specifications, we create detailed test scenarios covering positive,
negative, performance, and usability aspects.</p>
<p>Using a hybrid agile-like model, we test features as they're ready and conduct a final
integration cycle to assess system readiness. Given that we work with firmware and
embedded solutions, achieving 100% test automation is a significant challenge. As a
result, our approach includes a considerable amount of manual testing to ensure thorough
coverage and reliability. This process ensures seamless component interactions, uncovers
overlooked issues, and delivers actionable insights so we can ship
high-quality systems that exceed user expectations.</p>
<p>AMI is committed to upholding rigorous standards in testing, including a strict test exit
criterion that mandates zero high severity bugs before product release. This ensures that all
solutions delivered to clients meet the highest levels of reliability and performance. Our
testing methodologies are designed to identify and resolve any critical issues at an early
stage, preventing them from affecting the functionality of end products.</p>
<h3>What other technologies does testing at AMI involve</h3>
<p>At AMI, testing leverages tools like Python for automation scripting and Robot Framework
for test case creation and execution.
Previously, AMI utilized a custom-built test management system to organize test cases and
generate actionable reports.</p>
<p>AMI uses GitLab CI for triggering test jobs.
We have CI workflows that execute daily and weekly runs of our automated tests.
We would like to get to a point where our systems can
analyse what features a code change impacts and then it selects the test cases needed to
execute to test that changeset.</p>
<h3>Why did you decide to use Kiwi TCMS</h3>
<p>The legacy homegrown tool faced significant limitations as it struggled to keep up with the
scaling demands of AMI's growing testing infrastructure.
It was slow and could no longer support our evolving need for real-time reporting,
lacked flexibility, and was unable to accommodate new features, primarily due to the absence
of dedicated personnel to maintain and upgrade it. These constraints led the QA team to seek modern
solutions capable of addressing their evolving requirements effectively.</p>
<p>We conducted extensive research into alternative solutions, but
many tools we evaluated were either overly complex or prohibitively expensive. Kiwi TCMS
emerged as the perfect choice, seamlessly aligning with our requirements for affordability
and functionality.</p>
<h3>Where does Kiwi TCMS fit into AMI's overall testing infrastructure</h3>
<p>Kiwi TCMS has become a mission-critical tool for us, drastically
reducing latency while maintaining a lightweight and responsive design. Its versatility
ensures widespread use across AMI's testing infrastructure, benefiting not just testers but
also project managers and developers. The integration with JIRA further enhances our
workflow efficiency.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Kiwi TCMS API and the <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/tcms-api/">tcms-api</a>
client-side library are a great foundation which
enables us to create custom integrations, allowing
the AMI team to develop tailored workflows that fit their unique requirements.</p>
<p>For example, we have built a custom web application which provides
data visualizations and reporting capabilities that are tailored to meet the needs of our
stakeholders and customers. These custom solutions empower the QA team to provide actionable insights
into testing quality, enhancing transparency and fostering trust across all levels of
collaboration within our organization.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the words of <em>Utpal Patel, Senior Director, Global Test Engineering</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a highly successful two-year run with Kiwi TCMS, we have transitioned
to a <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription to better accommodate the rapid growth at AMI. This move
underscores our commitment to leveraging Kiwi TCMS as a cornerstone of our testing
infrastructure. We're excited about collaborating closely with the Kiwi TCMS development
team to refine it further, introducing features and capabilities that not only
strengthen our own workflows but also contribute valuable enhancements for the broader
testing community.</p>

            <p><img alt="&quot;SIU + Kiwi TCMS logos&quot;" src="/images/customers/siu-argentina+kiwitcms.png" title="SIU + Kiwi TCMS logos"></p>
<p>For more than 25 years,
<a href="https://www.siu.edu.ar/">Sistema de Informaci√≥n Universitaria</a> - SIU - has been
developing solutions for the digital management of the Argentine university
system and various government agencies.</p>
<p>This ecosystem of solutions integrates all management areas within an institution
(administrative, financial, academic, human resources, purchasing and assets, data analysis),
optimizing process management, data quality, transparency, and decision-making.</p>
<p>One of the main pillars of SIU is its collaborative network based on communities of practice.
In these communities, users interact, exchange knowledge and best practices,
solve common challenges, and share experiences. This governance model has gained national and
international recognition and has enabled successful implementations in over 140 institutions.</p>
<h3>The Kiwi TCMS experience</h3>
<p>In recent years, digital transformation and the evolution of the institution
have led SIU to move from a structure based on specific solutions to integrated
project management, requiring the search for new tools to streamline and improve
software development. As part of this process, a test management system was evaluated.</p>
<p>This experience began with the <strong>Integrated Electronic File</strong> solution,
a tool designed to seamlessly manage documents and files within an institution.
One of its components, <strong>SUDOCU</strong> (Unique Document System), was developed by
<a href="https://www.ungs.edu.ar/">Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento</a> - UNGS -
and made available to the Argentine university system through SIU.
This feature added complexity for the QA team during their work,
as test cases had to be replicated on different platforms both on the SIU and UNGS sides.</p>
<p>In order to simplify processes and avoid duplicated efforts, a tool was sought
to streamline the workflow. After evaluating several options, Kiwi TCMS was selected
because of its open source nature, which is in line with SIU's policy.</p>
<p>Evaluation began with a local installation, testing its functionalities,
and optimizing its use to improve workflow. After adjustments in both test and production environments,
Kiwi TCMS was incorporated into SUDOCU's projects, creating test cases and test plans.
This improved the organization and visibility of testing activities for the entire team involved,
including QAs, developers, and analysts.</p>
<p>Based on this initial implementation, a work plan was created to gradually integrate testing
of more projects into Kiwi TCMS, taking into account the unique characteristics of the SIU ecosystem.</p>
<p>Currently, a consolidated QA team has been established within SIU,
working in a fully integrated manner. Other projects are now using Kiwi TCMS in their daily
operations for functional testing, system integration, regression testing and smoke testing.</p>
<h3>Impact and benefits</h3>
<p>The experience with Kiwi TCMS has enhanced the quality of software developed by
SIU by centralizing test cases, test plans and test executions.
This has improved both the traceability and transparency of QA work.
It also provided the ability to generate reports and metrics to further
evaluate and improve internal processes.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits for SIU is time optimization achieved by
reusing test cases and test plans,
as well as the ability to track an unlimited number of executions,
within the same test management tool.
In addition, Kiwi TCMS' integration with <strong>Gitlab</strong> and <strong>Redmine</strong> is very useful
for the institution, as these are other tools commonly used within SIU.</p>
<p>The flexibility of this system allows test cases to be extended as needed,
making it easier to adjust and update test cases or test plans in response to the development cycle.</p>
<p>In the words of <em>Lucas del Reguero Martinez, QA tester</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The implementation of Kiwi TCMS has provided significant advantages to the institution,
resulting in tangible benefits to users within the SIU community.
The plan for the future is to continue training teams on the tool to further democratize its use.</p>

            <p>Hello testers,
in the spirit of transparency we'd like to inform everyone that
on Dec 11th 2024 between 07:20-09:30 UTC Kiwi TCMS suffered a major outage!</p>
<p>The Kiwi TCMS web application was up and running, however the database behind
it had stopped accepting requests resulting in 500 Internal Server Error page visible
to everyone. A little over 1000 requests (both manual and via API) were affected!</p>
<p>As of this time service has been restored and our team is taking corrective actions.
So far it doesn't look like that there was loss of historical data.</p>

starting today we are discontinuing the ability to register user
accounts on <a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a>! New accounts can still
be created by logging in via the existing OAuth integrations - GitHub, GitLab and Google!</p>
<h2>How does this affect users</h2>
<ul>
<li>New account registrations via email+password are not possible anymore - use OAuth login</li>
<li>Existing users are able to login via OAuth and/or email+password - reset your password
  if forgotten</li>
<li>New subscription purchases will create user accounts automatically -
  reset your password before first login.
  <em>Note: existing subscribers already have accounts</em></li>
<li>Inviting new users to a Private Tenant, <code>PLUGINS -&gt; Tenant -&gt; Invite users</code>
  will create user accounts automatically - reset your password before first login</li>

<p>Attention testers! On behalf of the
<a href="https://fosdem-testingautomation.github.io/"><em>Testing and Continuous Delivery devroom</em></a>
we'd like to announce that call for participation is now open.
This room is about building better software through a focus on testing and
continuous delivery practices across all layers of the stack.
The purpose of this devroom is to share good and bad examples around the question
‚Äúhow to improve quality of our software by automating tests, deliveries or deployments‚Äù
and to showcase new open source tools and practices.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> for FOSDEM 2025 this devroom is a merger between the former
<em>Testing and Automation</em> and <em>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</em> devrooms and
is jointly organized between devroom managers in previous FOSDEM editions!
Kiwi TCMS is proud to be part of the team hosting this devroom!</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> devroom will take place on Saturday, February 1st 2025 at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/transportation/">ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium</a>!
Presentations will be streamed online but all accepted speakers are required to deliver
their talks in person!</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for topics that are a good fit for this devroom:</p>
<p>Testing in the real, open source world</p>
<ul>
<li>War stories/strategies for testing large scale or complex projects</li>
<li>Tools that extend the ability to test low-level code, e.g. bootloaders, init systems, etc.</li>
<li>Projects that are introducing new/interesting ways of testing "systems"</li>
<li>Address the automated testing frameworks fragmentation</li>
<li>Stories from end-users (e.g. success/failure)</li>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Continuous Deployment</li>
<li>Security in Software Supply Chain</li>
<li>Pipeline standardization</li>
<li>Interoperability in CI/CD</li>
<li>Lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)</p>
<ul>
<li>Project showcases, modern tooling</li>
<li>How your open source tool made developing quality software better</li>
<li>What tools do you use to setup your CI/CD</li>
<li>Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things
  "Not enough people in the open source community know how to use $X,
  but here's a tutorial on how to use $X to make your project better."</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past the devroom has seen both newbies/students and experienced professionals and
past speakers as part of the audience and talks covering from beginner/practical
to advanced/abstract topics. If you have doubts then submit your proposal and
leave a comment for the devroom managers and we'll get back to you.</p>
<p>To submit a talk proposal (you can submit multiple proposals if you'd like) use
<a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/">Pretalx</a>, the FOSDEM paper submission system.
Be sure to select <em>Testing and Continuous delivery</em>!</p>

            <p>Hello testers,
starting today we are introducing several important changes to our subscription backend.</p>
<h2>New hub.kiwitcms.eu accounts</h2>
<p>Subscribers have the ability to access extra
<a href="/containers/">container images</a> via private docker repositories.</p>
<p><strong>What is changing:</strong> hub.kiwitcms.eu account username will no longer be based on email address,
instead it is based on the subscription ID which is more stable over time.
Discovering your credentials is explained on the page above.</p>
<p>New accounts have been created automatically for those eligible!
Old accounts will continue to be active until <strong>December 31st 2024</strong>,
afterwards they will be removed! Make sure to update your
workflows with the new credentials before December 31st!</p>
<h2>Automatic account creation for new subscriptions</h2>
<p>Previously subscribers who purchased a subscription were required to create
an account on <a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> using the same email address
used during their purchase.</p>
<p><strong>What is changing:</strong> user accounts for new subscriptions will be created automatically
if they do not exist and a random password would be assigned to them. Customers will
be able to reset passwords for these accounts via
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/accounts/passwordreset/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/accounts/passwordreset/</a>! The account username
is sent as a reminder in the password reset email!</p>

            <p>Hello testers,
our team has worked with our largest customers in order to better define what the
<em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription is and how it can bring more value beyond the
Kiwi TCMS application itself. You can read about the details below.</p>
<h2>What is Managed Hosting by Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>This is our top-tier of support services, where the Kiwi TCMS team leverages
our existing experience of hosting and running the Kiwi TCMS application
in production. It is more about <em>the batteries included</em> which make
overall operations easier, rather than specific software features.</p>
<h2>Who is this subscription for</h2>
<p><em>Managed Hosting</em> is suitable for large organizations which consider
their Kiwi TCMS instance to be a mission critical piece of infrastructure.
These are typically organizations with hundreds or thousands of testers
which have more requirements towards security and performance.</p>
<h2>What do you get</h2>
<p>Everything from lower tier subscription plans!</p>
<p>Most notably you get access to all versions of
community &amp; enterprise releases and a SaaS namespace which could be useful for in-house
development and experimentation with Kiwi TCMS. The SaaS version
(or a self-deployed enterprise version) can also be used as a sandbox instance to exercise
backwards compatibility testing against the latest version of Kiwi TCMS before
we upgrade your designated production instance!</p>
<h2>What do all of the individual items mean</h2>
<p><strong>1x Kiwi TCMS hosted in AWS:</strong> we've been running Kiwi TCMS in production since 2017 without
major incidents so far! This is lots of application and operation specific experience which
allows us to run a Kiwi TCMS instance securely and efficiently for you.
<em>Managed Hosting</em> frees up
your DevOps team from figuring it all out and lets them work on higher priority items.</p>
<p>Under this subscription you may chose one of
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/">Amazon Web Services regions</a>
if you have team members concentrated in a specific geographic area. There is no guarantee for the
actual underlying technology, e.g. EC2, ECS, Lightsail or other - this is up to us!</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Kiwi TCMS would adjust application size in order to meet your performance requirements
within reason. The total cost of all consumed cloud resources should still be covered by your
monthly payment. In extreme scenarios we would ask you to purchase a higher quantity
of the same subscription.</p>
<p>NOTICE: This subscription price is per instance! For distributed deployments across multiple
data centers you have to adjust the quantity of items on the subscription!</p>
<p><strong>Fully isolated instance:</strong> means exactly that - your database, web application and any additional
services (e.g. a Redis cache) will be completely isolated from resources provisioned for other customers
due to security concerns.</p>
<p>As part of the <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription you get an unlimited storage quota for
uploaded files and attachments. We may work with you to establish a data retention period if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Static files via global CDN:</strong> for <em>Managed Hosting</em> deployments all JavaScript, CSS
and related assets are served via a global content distribution network across hundreds of
edge locations in order to reduce latency and speed up page loading times in the browser.</p>
<p><strong>Email delivery via Amazon SES:</strong> depending on the amount of testing you perform Kiwi TCMS may be
sending lots of emails. Throughout the years we've observed that SMTP connections sometimes fail
resulting in unreliable service or email messages get marked as SPAM hurting the reputation of the sender.
This is also an area which requires prior configuration and does not work out of the box.</p>
<p><em>Managed Hosting</em> deployments use Amazon SES for email delivery which has the added benefit of
automatically managing blacklists when a delivery fails or is marked as SPAM. As part of
this subscription we will use an <code>@kiwitcms.org</code> email address authorized with Amazon SES!</p>
<p><strong>Delegated DNS &amp; SSL management:</strong> correct DNS and SSL configuration is vital for the
so called multi-tenant feature in Kiwi TCMS. This is the feature where you can create
unlimited namespaces of the type <code>team-1.tcms.example.com</code> and <code>product-2.tcms.example.com</code>
via the Kiwi TCMS web interface and have them available immediately.</p>
<p>A misconfigred DNS and/or misconfigured and/or expired SSL certificates is something that
happens regularly and leads to sub-optimal performance. With <em>Managed Hosting</em> we're going
to be managing all of this in the background.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: this requires that your company delegates an entire sub-domain, e.g.
<code>kiwitcms.example.com</code>, under our control!
If this isn't possible due to existing security policies we can configure a
<code>&lt;company&gt;.managed-hosting.kiwitcms.eu</code> DNS for you!</em></p>
<p><strong>Full application admin via web:</strong> as a customer you get the super-user account defined
in the Kiwi TCMS application and we promise that Kiwi TCMS staff will not login to minimize
the possibility of incidents. In any case we treat all of the data stored in a
<em>Managed Hosting</em> instance as confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Can override app/host settings:</strong> most of Kiwi TCMS' settings are not exposed via the web
interface and some customers find it cumbersome to override them. This is unfortunately
how the underlying application framework is designed to work. With a <em>Managed Hosting</em>
subscription our team will be taking care of this for you. This also extends to settings
of the underlying host system when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Kiwi TCMS upgrade upon request:</strong> currently an application upgrade involves human
interaction and is not something that can be automated as an unattended process.
Upgrading may also have implications towards backwards compatibility with 3rd
party systems and in-house software. That's why we would upgrade your instances
only after an explicit request and strive to keep downtime to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Regular security updates:</strong> relates to the underlying host OS (where applicable)
and web server configuration for Kiwi TCMS. With a <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription
our team will be keeping track of this for you. The underlying Postgres database
is not exposed via the Internet however we try to keep this up-to-date too!
Your InfoSec team is welcome to submit suggestions for improvements and we would
happily implement them where possible.</p>
<p><strong>Access to encrypted backups:</strong> our team performs regular backups for every Kiwi TCMS
instance within our care. All backups are encrypted using the popular open source tool
<a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>. This includes database and file uploads.</p>
<p>As part of the <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription we will work with your IT department and
provide you with shared access to these files in case you would like to keep your own
disaster recovery copy and/or to provision staging Kiwi TCMS instances with production like
data. Our team is open to further collaboration in this area!</p>
<p><strong>Extended support:</strong> as part of <em>Managed Hosting</em> subscription you get more support coverage,
<em>07-22 UTC/Mon-Sun</em>, this is 3 hours extra and coverage over the weekends
plus a <em>video conference</em> option when necessary in order to resolve
requests faster.</p>
<p><strong>Custom long-term billing terms:</strong> we can adjust your payment schedule so that
it works best for you. For example weekly, monthly, every 3 or 6 months, every 1, 2 or 3 years!</p>
<h2>Mid-term plans</h2>
<p><strong>Distributed deployment:</strong> running the Kiwi TCMS application across multiple regions,
e.g. Europe, US, Asia, for customers with a global workforce and high performance requirements.
Requires that you adjust the quantity of items on the subscription!</p>
<p><strong>Access to monitoring tools:</strong> we're exploring how to securely provide access
for each customer to our existing monitoring tools and/or implement new ones where needed.
This will allow your DevOps team to scrutinize how well we are doing and
provide us with valuable feedback. Let us know what you would be interested to have access to!</p>
<h2>Long-term plans</h2>
<p><strong>Hosting on Red Hat Enterprise Linux:</strong> in some cases we are running containers directly
onto a bare-metal or virtualized machine. We are exploring the possibility of using
Red Hat Enterprise Linux throughout the entire hosting stack and tying this with
Red Hat's existing management infrastructure without adding extra charges towards
our customers.</p>
<p><strong>Red Hat Enterprise Linux package upgrades:</strong> will apply to both host OS (where applicable)
and the kiwitcms/enterprise container application which is already built on top of
<a href="https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi9-minimal/61832888c0d15aff4912fe0d">Red Hat UBI 9</a>
container image.</p>
<p><strong>Security certifications via NDA:</strong> our vision is to be able to securely share existing and
future security related certifications with our <em>Managed Hosting</em> customers under a
non-disclosure agreement. Ideally we would enroll provisioned instances into a penetration testing
program which will be provided by a 3rd party vendor. Let us know if you have specific suggestions here.</p>
<p><strong>24/7 support:</strong> the first step here will be to refactor our existing support program
and migrate to a ticket management system. Ideally such system will be open source too.
At a later date our goal is to have 24x7 coverage in order to minimize response times!</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>
