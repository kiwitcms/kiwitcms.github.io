        <div class="article">
            <p>Hello testers, Kiwi TCMS has taken on a brave new
mission! We would like to transform the testing process by making it more
organized, transparent &amp; accountable for everyone on your team. Our goal
is to improve engineering productivity and participation in
testing. The following blog post outlines how we would like to achieve
this and what goals we put before ourselves for this year.</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p>Last year we took on the challenge to bring a legacy code base up to modern
coding standard. We did not complete that effort but made very good progress
along the way. This is not a small task and that's why our team will continue
with it this year.</p>
<p><img src="/images/codeclimate_jan_2019.png" style="float:none"
     alt="CodeClimate report" title="CodeClimate report"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a>:
  0 issues, 0% technical debt, health score A</li>
<li><a href="https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/kiwitcms/Kiwi/">Scrutinizer</a>:
  only A and B type issues</li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/475946313">Pylint</a>: 0 issues</li>
<li>Remove vendored-in Handlebars, jQuery, jQuery-UI and TableDnD JavaScript
  libraries in favor of existing npm dependencies</li>
<li>Front-end uses the existing JSON-RPC instead of backend views that
  are only used for AJAX requests. Tip: these are usually accessed via
  <code>postToURL()</code> and <code>jQ.ajax()</code> on the front-end</li>
<li>Inspect and classify all 3rd party issues reported from
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/kiwitcms-kiwi">Coverity</a> and
  <a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/475946312">Bandit</a>. Report and fix
  what we can, ignore the rest that do not affect Kiwi TCMS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p>There are 59 templates remaining to be converted to a modern look and feel.
Along with them comes more refactoring and even redesign of the existing pages
and the workflow around them. Together with refactoring this will make Kiwi TCMS
easier to use and also to maintain.</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting</h2>
<p>We are planning to remove the existing reports feature because they are not well
designed. We will re-implement existing functionality that our community finds useful,
add new types of reports (incl. nicer graphics and UI) and make it possible for the
reporting sub-system to be more easily extendable.</p>
<p>Phase out is planned to begin after 1st March 2019! Until then we are looking for your
feedback. Please comment in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/657">Issue #657</a>!</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p>These will make it easier to collect results from automated test suites into
Kiwi TCMS for later analysis. Instead of creating scripts that parse the
results and talk to our API you will only have to install an additional package
in your test environment and configure the test runner to use it! Automation
test results will then appear inside Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin">JUnit 5 plugin</a> - already in progress</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/692">TestNG plugin</a> - RFC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/693">Django plugin</a> - RFC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/694">py.test plugin</a> - RFC</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to use such functionality leave your vote inside GitHub
issues! In case you would like to write a test-runner plugin you can find the
specification
<a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/2018/11/05/test-runner-plugin-specification/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: Does Kiwi TCMS integrate with JIRA?</p>
<p>Answer: Well, it does. How exactly do you want to integrate?</p>
<p>... silence ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following dialog happens every time someone asks me about bug-tracker
integration, especially with JIRA. The thing is integration is a specified
set of behavior which may or may not be desired in a particular team. As of now
Kiwi TCMS is able to open a URL to your bug-tracker with predefined field
values, add comments to bug reports and report a simple summary of bugs
inside a TestRun.</p>
<p>We recognize this may not be enough and together with the community we
really need to define what bug tracker integration means! The broader domain
of application lifecycle management tools (of which TCMS is a sub-set) have an
integrated bug tracking system. We can add something like this and save you
the trouble of using JIRA, however many teams have already invested in
integrating their infrastructure or just like other tools. For example we love
GitHub issues and our team regularly makes public reports about issues that
we find internally!</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Redefine what bug-tracker integration means, vote in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/698">Issue #698</a></li>
<li>Goal: Bug-tracker functionality inside Kiwi TCMS, similar to
  GitHub Issues. Vote in

  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/530">Issue #530</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p>Developers have their
<a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub PR flow</a> and if they
have done the job of having unit tests then they will merge only when things
are green! This leaves additional testing efforts kind of to the side and
doesn't really help with transparency and visibility. I'm not going to mention
having an automatically deployed staging environment for every change
because very few teams actually have managed to do this effectively.</p>
<p><img src="/images/github_kiwitcms_pr_status.png" style="float:none"
     alt="Kiwi TCMS statuses on GitHub PR" title="Kiwi TCMS statuses on GitHub PR"></p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Figure out how Kiwi TCMS can integrate with GitHub flow and bridge the gap.
  Please share and <code>+1</code> your wildest ideas in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/700">Issue #700</a>.</li>
<li>Follow up: depending on the results in #700 we will follow with other goals and
  sub-tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p>Speaking of modern engineering flow is your team truly agile? When and how
do you plan your testing activities ? Before the devel sprint or afterwards?
How many testers take part in refining product backlog and working on user stories?</p>
<p>Similar to GitHub flow lots of teams and open source projects are using Trello
to effectively organize their development process. Testing should not be left
behind and Kiwi TCMS may be able to help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Figure out how Kiwi TCMS fits into the overall <code>devel-test-planning</code>
  process for agile teams and what we can do to make this easier for testers.
  Please share and <code>+1</code> your wildest ideas in
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/701">Issue #701</a></li>
<li>Follow up: depending on the results in #701 we will follow with other goals and
  sub-tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p>What makes a test engineer productive when they need to assess product risk and
new features, when mapping product requirements documents (PRD) to test plans and
test cases, when collaborating on user stories and behavior specification ?
What makes developers, product owners, designers and other professionals productive
when it comes to dealing with testing ?</p>
<p>For example consider the following workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company has idea for a new product</li>
<li>In case this is a big product it may have its own mission, i.e. what kind
  of problem is it trying to solve and for which group of customers</li>
<li>Product backlog is then created which outlines features that map
  to the product mission</li>
<li>Then the team, together with test engineers perform example mapping
  and discuss and refine the initial feature requirements. User stories
  are created</li>
<li>Behavior specification may also be created</li>
<li>Test plans and test cases are the immediate product of BDD specs and
  desired user stories</li>
</ul>
<p>Later we iterate through the sprints and for each sprint something like
this happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desired product features are planned for development. They must be <em>complete</em>
  at least in terms of requirements, specs and tests</li>
<li>Devel writes code, maybe some unit tests, testers can also write automated tests
  and/or manually verify the current state of the feature being developed</li>
<li>Testing, including exploratory is performed before feature is merged</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>Devel is also part of testing, right? Product owners, UX and interaction
designers as well. Producing quality software product is a team effort!</p>
<p>In every step of the way Kiwi TCMS can provide notification wizards, guidelines
and/or documentation for best practices, facilitate tooling, e.g. to write user stories
and assess them or map out an exploratory testing session, etc. The list
of ideas is virtually endless. We can even go into deep learning, AI and
blockchain but honestly who knows how to use them in testing ?</p>
<p>Our team is not quite sure how this goal will look like 3 months from now
but we are certain that testing needs to happen first, last and all the time
during the entire software development lifecycle. By providing the necessary
functionality and tools in Kiwi TCMS we can boost engineering productivity
and steer the testing process in your organization into a better, more productive
direction which welcomes participation from all engineering groups.</p>
<p>Let's consider another point of view: testing is a creative activity
which is benefited by putting your brain into a specific state of mind!
For example Gherkin (the Given-When-Then language) has the benefit of
forcing you to think about behavior and while doing so you are vocalizing
the various roles in the system, what kind of actions are accepted and
what sort of result is expected! Many times this will help you remember or
discover missing scenarios, edge cases and raise even more questions!</p>
<p>Crazy ideas, brain dumps and <code>+1</code> as always are welcome in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/703">Issue #703</a>.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Coding alone is not fun! Here's what you can do to help us:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/stargazers">Become a stargazer</a> by clicking the
  <code>Star</code> button on our GitHub repository</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/KiwiTCMS">Follow @KiwiTCMS on Twitter</a></li>

<li>Vote with a <code>+1</code> reaction on GitHub issues (top-right corner)</li>
<li>Send us testimonials and feedback about using Kiwi TCMS.
  We will be happy to publish them on our website</li>
<li>Send us a pull request on GitHub</li>
<li><a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">Become a sponsor</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also looking to expand our core team and the list of occasional
contributors. The following are mostly organizational goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: participate in 5 conferences with a project stand</li>
<li>Goal: define how we find, recruit and onboard new team members. The
  foundation is already set in
  <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/3/kiwi-tcms-team-onboarding#testcases">TP-3</a></li>
<li>Goal: clearly mark GitHub issues which are suitable for external contributors
  which don’t want to spend lots of time learning how Kiwi TCMS works under the hood.
  We're going to tag all such issues with the
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/labels/help%20wanted">
    <img src="/images/github_helpwanted.png" style="float: none; margin:0"
         alt="GitHub help wanted" title="GitHub help wanted">
  </a> label</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development policy</h2>
<p>Our team will be working on areas related to the goals above. A <code>+1</code>
reaction on GitHub issues will help us prioritize what we work on!</p>
<p><img src="/images/github_plus_one.png" style="float:none"
     alt="GitHub +1" title="GitHub +1"></p>
<p>Bug fixes and other
issues will be occasionally slipped into the stream and pull requests from
non-team contributors will be reviewed and merged in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>There is at least 1 full day of work that goes behind the scenes when
a new version is officially released: compile changelog, build images and
upload them, create blog post and newsletter announcement, share on social
media, etc. We also deploy on our own Kiwi TCMS instance as a stop-gap
measure before making everything public!</p>
<p>New PyPI tarballs and Docker images will be released every few weeks as
we see fit, this has been our standard process. We try to align releases
with Django's release schedule and try to cut a new version when there are known
security vulnerabilities fixed. However we can't guarantee this will always
be the case!</p>
<p>If you are in a hurry and need something quickly the best option is to
send a pull request, build your own Docker image from source and
maybe consider
<a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms">sponsoring us via Open Collective</a>!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="article">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals in our 2018
<a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>
(<a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/2018/07/25/mid-year-roadmap-status-report/">mid-year update here</a>).
TLDR; goals are completed at 62%. Refactoring legacy code is showing good results,
less so on the front-end side and there are items still in progress!</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> reported
a "D" rating with 600+ code smells and 600+ duplications and a 1 year estimation
to resolve these. We're now down to "C" rating with 171 smells and 203 duplications.</p>
<p>The level of technical debt has dropped from 32.5% down to 17.7% and we have removed
around 14000 lines of Python code and 8000 lines of JavaScript code without
losing significant functionality.</p>
<p>Checkout
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/trends/technical_debt">the stats</a>
for more info!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p><em>Status: almost finished</em></p>
<p>Both pylint and pylint-django have been integrated into our CI workflow. There are even
some custom built plugins that we use. The number of issues reported is down to 100
from 4000+ initially. These are predominantly <code>fixme</code> comments which are also in parts
of the code that are scheduled for removal and refactoring.</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Several views were modified to return pure JSON but we've not
done any targeted work to resolve this issue. A number of other views have been
removed in favor of using the existing JSON-RPC layer.</p>
<p>This is an internal refactoring effort which isn't very visible from the outside.
This is also one of the factors contributing to the high number of removed
source code.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Not much has been done in this area except the occasional refactoring to
JSON-RPC.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p><em>Status: complete</em></p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress, dropped</em></p>
<p>All RPC methods have been documented! The rest of the internals will be documented
as we go along.</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We still carry around jQuery, jQuery-UI and Handlebars.js. They will be
removed once the pages using them are converted to use the Patternfly widgets
library.</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>There are still over 50 HTML templates in <code>tcms/templates/</code> that need to be
refactored into Patternfly. We've been working on them one at a time and will
focus more on this effort in the next couple of months.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Some of the pages have been converted to use Patternfly. The most important pages
that still have a different look and feel are TestPlan view, TestCase view and
TestRun view. These are also the hardest to convert because they have lots of
tabs/components which pull information from various places. Our goal is to create
reusable widgets for the various components (e.g. a list of TestCases) and then
include these components into several different templates to minimize code
duplication.</p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>A number of JavaScript functions have been refactored and removed during the
past few releases but there are still thousands of lines of code left to deal with.
This effort is mostly happening in parallel with the Patternfly redesign.
We still don't have anything to test front-end JavaScript functionality!</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We are seeing a steady stream of new users registered on
<a href="https://demo.kiwitcms.org/login/github/">https://demo.kiwitcms.org</a> and
there are several active contributors on GitHub. Most of our translators are
very active and keep their respective languages fresh and up to date!</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS was represented at OSCAL Tirana, DjangoCon Heidelberg, PyCon Prague,
HackConf Sofia, PiterPy St. Petersburg and OpenFest Sofia. We've also been
approved for a project stand at FOSDEM 2019 so watch this blog for more news.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<h2>How to upgrade</h2>
<p>If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd Kiwi/
git pull
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi
docker pull centos/mariadb
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
</pre>
<p>Don't forget to <a class="reference external" href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/2018/07/30/how-to-backup-docker-volumes-for-kiwi-tcms/">backup</a>
before upgrade!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">kiwitcms/kiwi:latest</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> will
always point to the latest available version! If you have to upgrade in steps,
e.g. between several intermediate releases, you have to modify the above workflow:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# starting from an older Kiwi TCMS version
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
edit docker-compose.yml to use kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
# repeat until you have reached latest

            <p>Happy Monday testers! Kiwi TCMS needs your help! We are looking for developers who
wish to create plugins for popular test runners that will record test results
in Kiwi TCMS! Initially we are looking for plugins for Python's unittest,
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/testing/advanced/#using-different-testing-frameworks">Django</a>
and <a href="https://junit.org/junit4/plugins.html">JUnit</a>!</p>
<h2>What is a test runner?</h2>
<p>When working with automated testing you have several components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A test module (or test script), e.g. <code>test_models.py</code> which contains
  tests for your software;</li>
<li>A test framework, e.g. Python nose, which provides the structure
  for test classes and methods and assert methods to use;</li>
<li>A test runner, which knows how to discover your test scripts, load them,
  execute the testing scenarios inside of them and report the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Very often all of the components above live together inside the testing framework
but don't need to. For example the standard <code>unittest</code> module in Python
provides a test runner but there are also <code>nose</code> and <code>py.test</code> and Django provides
its own test runner that knows how to work with the database.</p>
<h2>Workflow organization</h2>
<p>Once you agree to writing a plugin we are going to create a separate GitHub
repository where you will be granted write privileges making you an independent
contributor to the Kiwi TCMS project!</p>
<p>Design and architecture of the plugin is up to you, following the practices
established by the testing framework in question. You will also have to create
a test suite for your plugin based on the specification below.</p>
<p>You are expected to use
<a href="https://demo.kiwitcms.org/login/github/">demo.kiwitcms.org</a> while working on the
plugin and afterwards. This is known as eating your own dog food!</p>
<p>For Python we provide the <code>tcms-api</code> module which already takes care of the
communications layer. For other languages you will have to create this layer or
depend on other open source libraries that provide a XML-RPC or JSON-RPC
client!</p>
<p>You can use
<a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/f5aed028b6f254d97bcaf93453abe8d2">this gist</a>
for inspiration!</p>
<h2>Behavior Specification</h2>
<p><em>Please use the comments section to discuss unclear behavior and missing scenarios!</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    SUMMARY: Will use configuration file if it exists
    GIVEN: the file ~/.tcms.conf exists
    WHEN: plugin initializes
    THEN: the plugin will log an info message, read the file and
    THEN: configure TCMS_API_URL, TCMS_USERNAME, TCMS_PASSWORD
          variables with the respective values


    SUMMARY: Will use ENVIRONMENT if configuration file doesn&#39;t exist
    GIVEN: the file ~/.tcms.conf does not exists
    WHEN: plugin initializes
    THEN: the plugin will read configuration from environment and configure
          the following variables/class members:
          TCMS_API_URL, TCMS_USERNAME and TCMS_PASSWORD


    SUMMARY: Will exit if TCMS_API_URL not configured
    GIVEN: TCMS_API_URL variable is empty
    WHEN: plugin initializes
    THEN: log a warning message and exit
    AND: depending on the test runner framework set exist status 1


    SUMMARY: Will exit if TCMS_USERNAME not configured
    GIVEN: TCMS_USERNAME is empty
    WHEN: plugin initializes
    THEN: log a warning message and exit
    AND: depending on the test runner framework set exist status 1


    SUMMARY: Will exit if TCMS_PASSWORD not configured
    GIVEN: TCMS_PASSWORD is empty
    WHEN: plugin initializes
    THEN: log a warning message and exit
    AND: depending on the test runner framework set exist status 1


    SUMMARY: Will re-use existing TestPlan if configured
    GIVEN: TCMS_RUN_ID environment variable is not empty
    WHEN: plugin initializes
    THEN:  this will be the Current_TestRun record to which the plugin is
           going to add test execution results
    AND: Current_TestPlan document in which the plugin will
           search for test cases becomes Current_TestRun.plan


    SUMMARY: Will create new TestPlan &amp; TestRun if TCMS_RUN_ID not configured
    GIVEN: TCMS_RUN_ID environment variable is empty
    THEN: plugin will create a new TestPlan in Kiwi TCMS with attributes:
        name=&#39;Automated test plan for %(product)&#39;
        product=&#39;%(product)&#39;
        product_version=&#39;%(version)&#39;

           %(version) is a placeholder for TCMS_PRODUCT_VERSION==TRAVIS_COMMIT==TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SHA==GIT_COMMIT
    THEN: plugin will crate a new TestRun in Kiwi TCMS with attributes:
        summary=&#39;Automated test run ....&#39;
        plan=Current TestPlan
        build=&#39;%(build)&#39;
        manager=TCMS_USERNAME
    WHERE: %(build) is a placeholder for TCMS_BUILD==TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER==BUILD_NUMBER

    https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#default-environment-variables
    https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project#Buildingasoftwareproject-belowJenkinsSetEnvironmentVariables

    SUMMARY: Will not create duplicate Product, Version &amp; Build if they already exist
    GIVEN: TCMS_RUN_ID is not configured
    AND: %(product) exists
    AND: %(version) exists
    AND: %(build) exists
    WHEN: plugin tries to auto-create TestPlan and TestRun
    THEN: plugin will re-use %(product), %(version) and %(build) from the database
    AND: not try to auto-create them


    SUMMARY: Will auto-create Product, Version &amp; Build if they don&#39;t exist
    GIVEN: TCMS_RUN_ID is not configured
    AND: %(product) doesn&#39;t exist
    AND: %(version) doesn&#39;t exist
    AND: %(build) doesn&#39;t exist
    WHEN: plugin tries to auto-create TestPlan and TestRun
    THEN: %(product), %(version) and %(build) be created automatically


    SUMMARY: Unit test names are added to TestPlan
    GIVEN: we have good plugin configuration
    WHEN: plugin loops over unit tests emitted by the test runner
    THEN: plugin will check Current_TestPlan for a TestCase with the same name
    AND: if test case doesn&#39;t exist in Current_TestPlan
    THEN: it will be added to Current_TestPlan
    hint: it is probably best to process all unit test results at the end!


    SUMMARY: Unit test names are added to TestRun
    GIVEN: we have good plugin configuration
    WHEN: plugin loops over unit tests emitted by the test runner
    THEN: plugin will check Current_TestRun for a TestCaseRun object which matches
          the current unit test name
    hint: (or Current_TestCase object from previous scenario, depending on implementation)
    AND: if such TestCaseRun doesn&#39;t exist in Current_TestRun
    THEN: it will be added to Current_TestRun
    hint: it is probably best to process all unit test results at the end!


    SUMMARY: Current_TestRun is updated with unit test results
    GIVEN: we have good plugin configuration
    WHEN: plugin loops over unit tests emitted by the test runner
    THEN: plugin will check Current_TestRun for a TestCaseRun object which matches
          the current unit test name
    hint: (or Current_TestCase object from previous scenario, depending on implementation)
    AND: if TestCaseRun object exists in Current_TestRun
    THEN: its status will be updated with the execution result coming from the test runner
    hint: it is probably best to process all unit test results at the end!

            <p>A friend from Red Hat sent me an email asking about Kiwi TCMS performance so I did
an experiment to establish a baseline.
For API requests I got <strong>7.5 req/sec or 130 msec/req</strong> which is
1.5x <a href="https://blog.github.com/2012-09-05-how-we-keep-github-fast/">slower than GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>I used <code>perf-script</code>
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/f5aed028b6f254d97bcaf93453abe8d2">gist here</a>)
to measure that. The script takes the first 250 test cases from our test suite
and on every execution creates a new TestPlan (1 API request), then creates
new test cases (250 requests), adds cases to test plan (250 requests),
creates new product build (1 API request), creates new TestRun (1 API request),
adds test cases to test run (250 requests) and finally updates the statuses
(250 requests).</p>
<p>A total of 1003 API requests are sent to Kiwi TCMS every time you start this script!
An example is available at <a href="https://demo.kiwitcms.org/run/567/">TR #567</a>!</p>
<p>On localhost, running the development server (<code>./manage.py runserver</code>) with an
SQLite database I got:</p>

            <p>We're happy to announce Kiwi TCMS version 6.1! This release
introduces new database migrations,
internal updates and bug fixes. It is a small release designed
to minimize the number of database migrations by squashing them together.
You can explore everything at
<a class="reference external" href="https://demo.kiwitcms.org/login/github/">https://demo.kiwitcms.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> there is the 6.0.1 release which resolves an upgrade problem
caused by non-applied migrations which have been later squashed and
released in the same release! It is best to jump through the intermediate
releases to ensure a smooth upgrade!</p>
<p>Supported upgrade paths:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
5.3   (or older) -&gt; 5.3.1
5.3.1 (or newer) -&gt; 6.0.1
6.0.1            -&gt; 6.1

<h2>Subscription based online service</h2>
<p>We are planning to convert
<a class="reference external" href="https://demo.kiwitcms.org/login/github/">https://demo.kiwitcms.org</a> into
a subscription based service for people who don't want to bother installing
Kiwi TCMS on their own systems and just want to use it for test collaboration
with their team.</p>
<p>The income from this service will go towards covering operating costs and
supporting the
<a class="reference external" href="http://kiwitcms.org/team/">development team</a>. Watch this
blog for further announcements about this. Meanwhile you may share your
thoughts via

<h2>Plans to remove deprecated functionality</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">TestRun.product_version</tt> will be removed from the database schema in favor of
<tt class="docutils literal">TestRun.plan.product_version</tt>! With the latest web interface it is not possible
to select a product version different than the one selected in the Test Plan.
Test runs should only be able to select product builds (after
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/246">Issue #246</a> is fixed).</p>

                    <a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/">Alexander Todorov</a>
                on Fri 12 October 2018
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="article">
            <p>I am happy to announce that <a href="http://kiwitcms.org/team/">our team</a> is steadily growing!
As we work through our <a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>,
<a href="http://kiwitcms.org/blog/atodorov/2018/07/25/mid-year-roadmap-status-report/">status update here</a>, and
on-board new team members I start to feel the need for a bit more structure
and organization behind the scenes. I also wish for consistent contributions
to the project (commit early, commit often) so I can better estimate the resources
that we have!</p>
<p>I am also actively discussing Kiwi TCMS with lots of people at various conferences
and generate many ideas for the future. The latest SEETEST in Belgrade was particularly
fruitful. Some of these ideas are pulling into different directions and I need help
to keep them under control!</p>
<p>Development-wise sometimes I lose track of what's going on and who's doing what between
working on Kiwi TCMS, preparing for conferences and venues to promote the project,
doing code review of other team members, trying not to forget to check-in on
progress (especially by interns), recruiting fresh blood and thinking about
the overall future of the project. Our user base is growing and there are days
where I feel like everything is happening at once or that something
needs to be implemented ASAP (which is usually true anyway)!</p>
<p><img class="rounded" src="/images/team/rstankova.jpg"></p>
<p>Meet Rayna Stankova in the role of our team coach!
Reny is a director for Women Who Code Sofia, senior QA engineer at VMware,
mentor with CoderDojo Bulgaria and a long-time friend of mine.
Although she is an experienced QA in her own right she will be contributing
to the people side of Kiwi TCMS and less so technically!</p>
<p>Her working areas will be planning and organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>help us (re)define the project vision and goals</li>
<li>work with us on roadmaps and action plans so we can meet
  the project goals faster</li>
<li>help us (self) organize so that we are more efficient,
  including checking progress and blockers (aka enforcer) and
  meet the aforementioned consistency point</li>
<li>serve as our professional coach, motivator and somebody who will
  take care of team health (yes I really suck at motivating others)</li>
</ul>
<p>and generally serving as another very experienced member of the team!</p>
<p>We did a quick brainstorming yesterday and started to produce results
(#smileyface)! We do have a team docs space to share information
(non-public for now, will open it gradually as we grow) and came up
with the idea to use Kiwi TCMS as a check-list for our on-boarding/internship
process!</p>
<p>I don't know how it will play out but I do expect from the
team to self-improve, be inspired, become more focused and more productive!
<strong>All of this also applies to myself, even more so!</strong></p>
<h2>Existing team members progress</h2>
<p>Last year we started with 2 existing team members (Tony and myself) and 3
new interns (Ivo, Kaloyan and Tseko) who built this website!</p>
<p>Tony is the #4 contributor to Kiwi TCMS in
terms of <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/graphs/contributors">number of commits</a>
and is on track to surpass one of the original authors (before Kiwi TCMS was forked)!
He's been working mostly on internal refactoring and resolving the thousands
of pylint errors that we had (down to around 500 I think). This summer Tony and I
visited the OSCAL conference in Tirana and hosted an info booth for the project.</p>
<p>Ivo is the #5 contributor in terms of numbers of commits. He did learn very
quickly and is working on getting rid of the remaining pylint errors. His ability
to adapt and learn is quite impressive actually. Last month he co-hosted a
git workshop at HackConf, a 1000+ people IT event in Sofia.</p>
<p>Kaloyan did most of the work on our website initially (IIRC).
Now he is studying in the Netherlands
and not active on the project. We are working to reboot his on-boarding
and I'm hoping he will find the time to contribute to Kiwi TCMS regularly.</p>
<p>From the starting team only Tseko decided to move on to other ventures after
he contributed to the website.</p>
<h2>Internship program</h2>
<p>At Kiwi TCMS we have a set of training
programs that teach all the necessary technical skills before we let anyone
actively work on the project, let alone become a team member.</p>
<p>Our new interns are Denitsa Uzunova and Desislava Koleva. Both of them are
coming from Vratsa Software Community and were mentors at the recently held
CodeWeek hackathon in their home city! I wish them fast learning and good luck!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p>In this blog post I will show more ways to customize Kiwi TCMS by adding
logging capabilities to the API backend. Indeed this is a feature that
our team deemed not required for upstream and was removed in
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/436">PR #436</a>.</p>
<p>Start by creating the following directory structure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    api_logging/
        __init__.py
        handlers.py
        models.py

<p>This is a small Django application that will log every call to the API backend.
Each file looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
You will have to execute <code>./manage.py makemigrations api_logging</code> to create the
initial migration for Django. This could be easier if you place the above directory
into existing Django application or craft the migration file by hand!</p>
<p>The last thing you want to do is create a <code>local_settings.py</code> file which will override
Kiwi TCMS defaults:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="c1"># local_settings.py</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">settings</span>

    <span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;api_logging&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>

    <span class="n">MODERNRPC_HANDLERS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;api_logging.handlers.XMLRPCHandler&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                          <span class="s1">&#39;api_logging.handlers.JSONRPCHandler&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then place everything in <code>Dockerfile</code> like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    FROM kiwitcms/kiwi

    COPY ./api_logging/ /venv/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/api_logging/
    COPY local_settings.py /venv/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/tcms/settings/
</pre></div>


<p>Kiwi TCMS will import your <code>local_settings.py</code> and enable the logging application.
Now build your customized Docker image and use it for deployment!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p>We're happy to announce Kiwi TCMS version 5.3.1! This release
brings lots of UI updates and removal of unused
and/or duplicated functionality and source code. Many pages have been redesigned
with the Patternfly library to have a modern look and feel which you can
experience at <a class="reference external" href="https://demo.kiwitcms.org/login/github/">https://demo.kiwitcms.org</a>.</p>
<p>This will be the last release to carry around squashed migrations. In version
6.0 older migrations will be deleted and replaced with their squashed equivalents.
Upgrades from versions &lt; 5.3 to 6.0 will break without an intermediate upgrade to 5.3.1!</p>
<p>Use <tt class="docutils literal">kiwitcms/kiwi:5.3.1</tt> from Docker Hub when upgrading at some point in the future!</p>

<h2>Plans to remove deprecated functionality</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">TestRun.product_version</tt> will be removed from the database schema in favor of
<tt class="docutils literal">TestRun.plan.product_version</tt>! With the latest web interface it is not possible
to select a product version different than the one selected in the Test Plan.
Test runs should only be able to select product builds (after
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/246">Issue #246</a> is fixed).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">TestRun.estimated_time</tt> is scheduled for removal if not used. Objections

<p><tt class="docutils literal">EnvGroup</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">EnvProperty</tt> models are scheduled for removal in favor
of <tt class="docutils literal">Tag</tt>. Internally tags are referenced in more places inside Kiwi TCMS'

        <div class="article">
            <p>This is the first publication in our customization series. It will show you
how to override any template used by Kiwi TCMS. As an example we will override
the email template that is used when registering new account. By default the
email text looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">    Welcome </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">user</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">,</span>
<span class="x">    thank you for signing up for an </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">site_domain</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> account!</span>

<span class="x">    To activate your account, click this link:</span>
<span class="x">    </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">confirm_url</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p><a href="https://demo.kiwitcms.org/login/github/">https://demo.kiwitcms.org</a>
runs a custom Docker image based on
<code>kiwitcms/kiwi</code>. For this image the confirmation email looks like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">    Welcome </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">user</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">,</span>
<span class="x">    thank you for signing up for our Kiwi TCMS demo!</span>

<span class="x">    To activate your account, click this link:</span>

</pre></div>


<p>The file that we want to override is <code>tcms/templates/email/confirm_registration.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Create a local directory (git repository) which will hold customization configuration
and create a file named <code>templates.d/email/confirm_registration.txt</code> with your text!</p>
<p>Next you want to make this file available inside your docker image so your <code>Dockerfile</code>
should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    FROM kiwitcms/kiwi

    COPY ./templates.d/ /venv/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/tcms/overridden_templates/
    COPY local_settings.py /venv/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/tcms/settings/
</pre></div>


<p>where <code>local_settings.py</code> contains</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">settings</span>

    <span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TEMPLATES</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;DIRS&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TCMS_ROOT_PATH</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;overridden_templates&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The following code states <em>instruct Django to look into <code>overridden_templates</code> first and
use any templates it finds there; also make my files available in that specific location
inside the docker image</em>.</p>
<p>This approach can be used for all templates that you wish to override. Take into
account that file names must match (Django searches templates by directory path).
Now build your customized Docker image and use that for deployment!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
