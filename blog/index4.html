        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers,
the Kiwi TCMS team sat down together last week and talked about what we feel
is important for us during the upcoming year. This blog post outlines our
roadmap for 2020!</p>
<p><img style="background-color: inherit" src="/images/roadmap2020.png" alt="roadmap image 2020"></p>
<h1>Project sustainability</h1>
<p>The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means several key areas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Team</span>
<span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Technical</span>
<span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Community</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Right now we have a core team with 6 newcomers on-boarding.
Engineering performance is all over the place with some people contributing
too much while others contributing too little. More importantly there is no
consistent pace of contributions which makes planning timely completion of
technical tasks impossible.</p>
<p>At the moment we do operate as a bunch of disconnected people who happen to
talk to each other from time to time.</p>
<p>We are going to adjust our internal processes and how we on-board new members.
In fact we did our first "scrum-like" meeting this week and agreed to change
our existing practice and strive to become better as a team!</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> to have a cohesive team at the end of the year which operates with
a predictable capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete remaining <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry features</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> complete
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">bug-tracker integration milestone</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> all pylint issues resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> migrate all remaining legacy templates to Patternfly UI. See
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/3">patternfly-migration</a> milestone.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> where FE sends AJAX requests to BE views replace with JSON RPC API instead.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> start tackling the JavaScript mess that we have. This depends and is related
to Patternfly migration and overall refactoring.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> make it easier for downstream installations to extend and override parts
of Kiwi TCMS in order for users to adjust the system to their own needs.
The system is pretty flexible as-is but there have been requests,
both online and offline, to provide some extra features! We'll start looking
into them, likely making partial progress in the next 12 months.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success at every single conference that we've been to.
Both project and team have been well received. While we are going to continue
being part of various communities around the world we are trying to limit
extensive travel and focus on functionality and partnerships which will
increase Kiwi TCMS eco-system, make the project even more popular and
drive further adoption!</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> extended GitHub integration via
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/">kiwitcms-github-app</a> plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> release the following
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html">test automation framework plugins</a>
for Kiwi TCMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/phpunit-plugin/">PHPUnit plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/pytest-plugin/">py.test plugin</a></li>
<li>TestNG plugin</li>
<li>Jenkins plugin</li>
<li>Robot framework plugin</li>
<li>Django plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/2">test-automation-plugins</a> milestone.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> work with our partners from the proprietary and open source worlds.
This is hard to quantify and lots of it doesn't actually depend on the team.
However we are continuing to talk to them regularly. Expect new feedback to
become available under GitHub Issues.</p>
<p><strong>Extra:</strong> see what we can do about testing productivity! This has always been
part of our mission but we have not been able to produce anything worth sharing.
We do have ideas in this space but we are generally looking for partnerships and collaborations.
It is very likely that there will not be very much progress on this front
because it is hard to define it properly :-(.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>At the end of the day most of these goals compliment each other and help drive all of
them to completion. Many of the still on-boarding people have expressed desire to
improve their Python &amp; Django skills. Working to resolve issues in the above specific
areas will give them this opportunity! I expect they will show good progress on their respective
tasks so we can write more about them on this blog.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd path/containing/docker-compose/
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi
docker pull centos/mariadb
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate

<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> has been updated from your private git repository!
The file provided in our GitHub repository is an example. Not for production use!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">kiwitcms/kiwi:latest</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> will
always point to the latest available version! If you have to upgrade in steps,
e.g. between several intermediate releases, you have to modify the above workflow:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# starting from an older Kiwi TCMS version
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
edit docker-compose.yml to use kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;

                    <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/">Kiwi TCMS Team</a>
                on Sun 12 January 2020
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello testers, Kiwi TCMS is migrating from its OAuth backend
to the so called "GitHub App" backend in order to enable further
integration with GitHub's PR flow as stated previously in our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">yearly goals</a>.
This blog post outlines the differences between the old and the new!</p>
<p>The old OAuth application only had access to your username, name and email
for authentication purposes. Its authorization screen looked like so:</p>
<p><img src="/images/github/oauth_login.png"
    alt="OAuth login screen"
    style="float:none"></p>
<p>GitHub Apps on the other hand are designed for more granular access and tighter
integration with the GitHub platform. This type of application still allows you
to perform 1-click login into
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a>. If this is your
first time logging into Kiwi TCMS after the migration you will see the following screen:</p>
<p><img src="/images/github/app_login.png"
    alt="App login screen"
    style="float:none"></p>
<p>Notice how the heading, information section and action button are slightly different!
The important section is <strong>Resources on your account</strong>! We still only need your
name, username and email address! Existing Kiwi TCMS accounts (from before the migration)
will continue to work and they will still have access to all of their data previously
created. Authorization of this new GitHub app (e.g. login only) does not give it
permissions to access your repositories and act on your behalf.</p>
<p>To permit this GitHub App to access your repositories and/or act on your behalf
you must <strong>Install</strong> it first. That is tell Kiwi TCMS GitHub integration code
what kind of resources from your GitHub account it is allowed to access. You may
install into your personal GitHub account or an organizational account! You may
do this by following the <strong>Install &amp; Authorize</strong> button on our home page or
directly from <a href="https://github.com/apps/kiwi-tcms">https://github.com/apps/kiwi-tcms</a>!
The screen should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/github/app_installation.png"
    alt="App installation screen"
    style="float:none"></p>
<p>Initially we ask for read-only access to a few resources so Kiwi TCMS can start
receiving webhooks from GitHub and synchronize information about your repositories
into our database. This is documented both on the app installation screen itself
(required by GitHub) and on
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app">https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app</a>!</p>
<p>Further ideas about integration between GitHub and Kiwi TCMS, including the original
idea about status checks from <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/700">Issue #700</a>,
can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues">https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues</a>.</p>
<h2>Help us grow</h2>
<p>After this migration we're back to zero! The thousands of authorizations we've had
on our legacy OAuth app can't be migrated to the new app. This also means our
listing on GitHub Marketplace will be taken down and we have to qualify through the
entire process from scratch.</p>
<p>Please help us get back on track! Here's what we ask you to do (in this order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> and
  click the GitHub login icon, follow through with the process;</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/apps/kiwi-tcms">https://github.com/apps/kiwi-tcms</a> and
  click the <strong>Install</strong> button, select account &amp; repositories and complete the
  process;</li>
<li>Share this blog post with friends, co-workers and other testers who might be
  interested to help!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you! Happy testing and happy new year!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">2019 roadmap</a>.
TL,DR: last year we've made lots of big and visible changes in Kiwi TCMS.
This year less so. Progress has been slower than before and not so much
visible. Community and team is growing. More contributors are welcome.</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p><em>Status: small progress, needs help</em></p>
<p><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> progress is:</p>
<ul>
<li>-60 code smells</li>
<li>-55 duplications</li>
<li>-50 other issues</li>
<li>4.4% technical debt improvement</li>
<li>-240 hrs remaining until issues are fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>The trend is showing less issues remaining
but it has been a slow progress. As we fix the easier items the remaining ones
become harder to deal with.</p>
<p>We've done minor work related to fixing issues reported by pylint. Around
150 of them still remain!</p>
<p>We have not done any targeted work to resolve other issues reported by Scrutinizer,
remove vendored-in JavaScript libraries, JavaScript refactoring or
classification of issues in 3rd party dependencies.</p>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: 60% done, needs help</em></p>
<p>There are 22 HTML templates remaining to be redesigned (from 59). That's mostly
due to internal cleanup and some refactoring! Test plan and Test run pages are the
two major templates that still need to be redesigned with Patternfly.</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting aka Telemetry</h2>
<p><em>Status: 60% done, in progress, behind schedule</em></p>
<p>The specs for the new <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry</a> system
have been defined after taking into account feedback on GitHub issues. Anton Sankov is
the leading developer for this feature. So far we have 4 telemetry reports merged:
testing break-down, status matrix, execution trends and flaky tests.</p>
<p>There are lots of minor issues or missing functionality in these first iterations
(compared to specification). Work continues on the other telemetry use-cases
and related items.</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p><em>Status: good, needs help</em></p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em> no change in last 6 months.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see plugins for more test automation frameworks
and/or file formats please checkout the
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automation-frameworks.html">documentation</a>
for links and more info.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: 66% complete, in progress, behind schedule</em></p>
<p>We've been making slow progress on this milestone lately. For more info
see
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1">https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1</a></p>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: done, awaiting deployment</em></p>
<p>Our team spent some time making Kiwi TCMS the first open source TCMS available
on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms">GitHub Marketplace</a>. At the end
of this year we were able to create a small application that allows further
integration and extending the testing workflow to the GitHub platform.</p>
<p>This is waiting on a few more clarifications from GitHub before we deploy but
for now it can be considered as done. Future functionality will be tracked
and developed directly at
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues">https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues</a>.</p>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress, will drop</em></p>
<p>This will be dropped from roadmap for the next year until we can get more interest
from the community.</p>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Looking for external help here. This will stay as a low priority item on our
roadmap for 2020 until we can free more resources on the team.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><em>Status: great, on track, needs work</em></p>
<p>This is our strongest area during this year. We have a strong presence in
multiple communities, our event schedule is very busy and we are gaining more
recognition every day! Core team hit several big bumps this year and is still
recovering with a few more people onboarding.</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS suffers from the problem that many of our users can't be contributors
or simply don't want to!</p>
<p>In short: it is important for us to follow our mission and develop our core team
so we can deliver on promises made in our roadmap! That requires a lot of time and
effort which reduces short-term productivity.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<h2>How to upgrade</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/30/how-to-backup-docker-volumes-for-kiwi-tcms/">Backup</a> first!
If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd path/containing/docker-compose/
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi
docker pull centos/mariadb
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
</pre>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> has been updated from your private git repository!
The file provided in our GitHub repository is an example. Not for production use!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">kiwitcms/kiwi:latest</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> will
always point to the latest available version! If you have to upgrade in steps,
e.g. between several intermediate releases, you have to modify the above workflow:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# starting from an older Kiwi TCMS version
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
edit docker-compose.yml to use kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
# repeat until you have reached latest

            <p class="post-meta">Posted by
                    <a href="/blog/atodorov/">Alexander Todorov</a>
                on Mon 11 November 2019
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Starting with version 7.0 Kiwi TCMS pages displaying URLs to bugs also
contain an info icon which shows additional information as tooltip. These
are designed to provide more contextual information about the bug. By default
the tooltip shows the OpenGraph metadata for that URL. This article
will explain how to override this in 2 different ways.</p>
<p><img src="/images/testcase_shows_bug_details.png" alt="bug details shown" style="float:none"></p>
<h2>Option #1: using the caching layer</h2>
<p>Additional bug information is cached on the application layer. The cache
key is the bug URL! By default Kiwi TCMS uses local-memory caching which
isn't accessible for external processes but can be reconfigured very easily.
This example changes the <code>CACHES</code> setting to use a directory on the
file system like so</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">CACHES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;default&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;BACKEND&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;LOCATION&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/tmp/kiwi-cache&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;TIMEOUT&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3600</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Then you need to poll your 3rd party bug tracker (and/or other systems) and
update the cache for each URL</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.core.cache</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">cache</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">tcms.core.contrib.linkreference.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">LinkReference</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">reference</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">LinkReference</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">is_defect</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># possibly filter objects coming only from your own bug tracker</span>
    <span class="c1"># in case there are multiple trackers in use</span>

    <span class="c1"># custom methods to grab more information. Must return strings</span>
    <span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fetch_title_from_bug_tracker</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">reference</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">description</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fetch_description_from_bug_tracker</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">reference</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1"># store the information in Kiwi TCMS cache</span>
    <span class="n">cache</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">reference</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;title&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;description&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">description</span><span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Then execute the Python script above regularly. For example use the following
as your cron script</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">VIRTUAL_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>/venv
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span>/venv/bin:<span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="si">}</span>
cat /path/to/cache_updater.py <span class="p">|</span> /Kiwi/manage.py shell
</code></pre></div>


<p><img src="/images/testcase_shows_bug_details_cache.png" alt="bug details from customized cache" style="float:none"></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kiwi TCMS expires cache entries after an hour. Either change
  the <code>TIMEOUT</code> setting shown above or run your script more frequently</li>
<li>How to modify default Kiwi TCMS settings is documented
  <a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing_docker.html#customization">here</a></li>
<li>The Python + Bash scripts above don't need to be on the same system where Kiwi TCMS
  is hosted. However they need the same Python 3 virtualenv and cache settings as
  Kiwi TCMS does</li>
<li>Information about Django's cache framework and available backends
  can be found <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/cache/">here</a></li>
<li><code>memcached</code> is a supported cache backend option, see
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/cache/#memcached">here</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-elasticache/">django-elasticache</a> is a
  backend for Amazon ElastiCache which provides several configuration examples</li>
<li>Both <a href="https://github.com/niwinz/django-redis">django-redis</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/sebleier/django-redis-cache">django-redis-cache</a> are good
  libraries which support Redis</li>
<li>Any 3rd party libraries must be <code>pip3 install</code>-ed into your own docker image</li>
</ul>
<h2>Option #2: extend bug tracker integration</h2>
<p>Let's say you are already running a customized Docker image of Kiwi TCMS. Then
you may opt-in to extend the existing bug tracker integration code which provides
the information shown in the tooltip. In this example I've extended the
<code>KiwiTCMS</code> bug tracker implementation but you can even provide your own from
scratch</p>

<p>Then import the new <code>ExtendedBugTracker</code> class inside
<code>tcms/issuetracker/types.py</code> like so</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gh">index 9ad90ac..2c76621 100644</span>

<p>and change the bug tracker type, via https://tcms.example.com/admin/testcases/bugsystem/,
to <em>ExtendedBugTracker</em>.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>ExtendedBugTracker</em> may live anywhere on the filesystem but Python must be
  able to import it</li>
<li>It is best to bundle all of your customizations into a Python package and
  <code>pip3 install</code> it into your customized docker image</li>
<li><em>ExtendedBugTracker</em> must be imported into <code>tcms/issuetracker/types.py</code> in order
  for the admin interface and other functions to find it. You may also place the
  import at the bottom of <code>tcms/issuetracker/types.py</code></li>
<li>API documentation for bug tracker integration can be found
  <a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/tcms.issuetracker.html">here</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> starting with <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2020/07/10/kiwi-tcms-85/">Kiwi TCMS v8.5</a>
external bug tracker integration classes are listed in the <code>EXTERNAL_BUG_TRACKERS</code>
setting. If you are using v8.5 or newer instead of
importing <code>ExtendedBugTracker</code> in <code>tcms/issuetracker/types.py</code> you should
override the list of available bug tracker integrations:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">EXTERNAL_BUG_TRACKERS</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;mymodule.ExtendedBugTracker&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2>How to upgrade</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/30/how-to-backup-docker-volumes-for-kiwi-tcms/">Backup</a> first!
If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd path/containing/docker-compose/
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi
docker pull centos/mariadb
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
</pre>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> has been updated from your private git repository!
The file provided in our GitHub repository is an example. Not for production use!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">kiwitcms/kiwi:latest</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> will
always point to the latest available version! If you have to upgrade in steps,
e.g. between several intermediate releases, you have to modify the above workflow:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# starting from an older Kiwi TCMS version
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
edit docker-compose.yml to use kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
# repeat until you have reached latest

<li>API method <tt class="docutils literal">BugSystem.filter()</tt> has been removed (now unused) but
it was possible to use this method to steal passwords or keys used for
Issue Tracker integration. This vulnerability could be exploited by
users logged into Kiwi TCMS and is classified as medium severity!

immediately!</li>

small info icon. Fixes

<li>Add method <tt class="docutils literal">Bug.details()</tt> which together with the underlying
<tt class="docutils literal">IssueTracker.details()</tt> is the foundation of how Kiwi TCMS fetches
extra details from the issue tracking system. The default implementation
uses OpenGraph protocol to collect the data that will be shown. You may
override <tt class="docutils literal">.details()</tt> for each issue tracker (or add your own IT) to
extend this functionality. Information is cached for 1 hour by default.

<h3>Removed functionality</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remove <tt class="docutils literal">IssueTrackerType.all_issues_link()</tt> method. This was used in
TestRun Report page to show a single link that will open all bugs in the
Issue Tracker. Most trackers don't support this and the UI portion has
been rewritten</li>
<li>Remove <tt class="docutils literal">LinkOnly</tt> issue tracker - obsolete because all defects are
now added to TestExecutions via their URLs</li>

<h2>How to upgrade</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/30/how-to-backup-docker-volumes-for-kiwi-tcms/">Backup</a> first!
If you are using Kiwi TCMS as a Docker container then:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd path/containing/docker-compose/
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi
docker pull centos/mariadb
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it kiwi_web /Kiwi/manage.py migrate
</pre>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> has been updated from your private git repository!
The file provided in our GitHub repository is an example. Not for production use!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">kiwitcms/kiwi:latest</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> will
always point to the latest available version! If you have to upgrade in steps,
e.g. between several intermediate releases, you have to modify the above workflow:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# starting from an older Kiwi TCMS version
docker-compose down
docker pull kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
edit docker-compose.yml to use kiwitcms/kiwi:&lt;next_upgrade_version&gt;
docker-compose up -d

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Next month our team will be at
<a href="https://pyconbalkan.com/">PyCon Balkan, Oct 3-5</a> in Belgrade. Together with
presentation and a workshop we are going to host open source sprints!
These will be an informal gathering where participants will be able to
learn more about how open source works and go through their first
contributions. This is ideal for students and less experienced people
but we welcome everyone. There will be tasks ranging from easy to very hard!</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> 4 mentors from Kiwi TCMS and you!</p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> full day of peer programming and contributing to Kiwi TCMS</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> room will be announced on the days of the conference,
           follow <a href="https://twitter.com/KiwiTCMS">@KiwiTCMS</a> for more info</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> up your tech skills, build your GitHub profile and have fun together</p>
<h2>Translate Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>We have enabled Serbian language in our translation system. To get started
checkout our
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html#translation">translation contribution</a>
page.
Once strings are translated <code>kiwitcms-bot</code> will automatically open a pull
request with the new text.</p>
<h2>Find unused CSS classes</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>This should be relatively easy. For each class/selector defined in our CSS files
search (grep) if any of the HTML templates use it. If it is not in use then remove
it.</p>
<h2>Find unused JavaScript code</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Similar to the above. We're not 100% certain but there could be legacy JavaScript
functions which are no longer in use. Find them and remove them! At the very least
you have confirmed that all functions are in use!</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Minor severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy to moderate</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=minor&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Minor severity issues</a>.
There are many of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS lint issues (we suggest you start with this one)</li>
<li>functions longer than 25 lines of code</li>
<li>functions with bigger cognitive and cyclomatic complexity</li>
<li>modules longer than 250 LOC</li>
</ul>
<p>Try fixing a few to see how it goes and continue if you feel confident.
Not everything may be an issue so if you have any questions ask someone from our team.</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Major severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: moderate to hard</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=major&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Major severity issues</a>.
There are around 150 of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>identical and similar code blocks</li>
<li>big modules</li>
<li>big functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these require some sort of refactoring, either splitting snippets
of code into smaller pieces (functions or sub-modules) or using one function
in several places instead of 2 very similar but different functions, etc.
Ask our team members about which approach they prefer for fixing these issues
to minimize the effort spent here.</p>
<h2>CodeClimate Critical severity issues</h2>
<p>Difficulty: hard</p>
<p>Check-out the
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?severity%5B%5D=critical&amp;status%5B%5D=&amp;status%5B%5D=open&amp;status%5B%5D=confirmed&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=structure&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=duplication&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=bandit&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=csslint&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=fixme&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=radon&amp;engine_name%5B%5D=sonar-python">list of Critical severity issues</a>.
All of these are functions with high cognitive complexity and
the recommended way to deal with them is refactoring into
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/">class based views</a>.</p>
<h2>Improve pylint health</h2>
<p>Difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Execute pylint against the latest sources and start fixing the issues.
Looking at <a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/579167487">pylint logs</a> the
following items are relatively easy to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything in module tcms.urls</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.telemetry.api</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.testruns.tests.test_views</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.xmlrpc.forms</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.testcases.tests.test_models</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.core.forms.fields</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.settings.common</li>
<li>Everything in module tcms.settings.test</li>
<li>All <code>module-in-directory-without-init</code> errors reported for module tcms.tests.__init__</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <code>fixme</code>, <code>missing-permission-required</code> and <code>avoid-auto-field</code> errors are usually harder
to resolve and will require more work/refactoring. If you feel confident go ahead and
fix them, if not skip to the next error message.</p>
<p>We also use a custom pylint checker which reports function based views.
If you are looking for something harder to work on, then give it a try
(see 3rd pylint line in <code>Makefile</code>) and refactor some of the existing
view functions into class based views.</p>
<h2>Fix 3rd party security issues discovered by Bandit</h2>
<p>Difficulty: moderate to hard</p>
<p>Bandit is a static analysis tool similar to pylint. It focuses on discovering
issues which may lead to security vulnerabilities. We have resolved all such
issues in our own source code but we also execute Bandit against the entire
Python dependency stack. There it finds thousands of issues, so much so that
the reporter crashes.</p>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/kiwitcms/Kiwi/jobs/579167486">In CI</a> there are around
130 issues reported. The best course of action here is to execute Bandit locally
against the offending library and then figure out what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>report an issue upstream</li>
<li>send a pull request upstream</li>
<li>if these are test files maybe exclude them from the package (e.g. don't ship them for production)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: inside Travis CI we have all runtime and testing dependencies which is more
than what we have inside the official Docker image for Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<h2>Work on reported issues</h2>
<p>The following issues look suitable for a sprint and don't require lots of
background knowledge. You can also find them using the
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/labels/PyConBalkan"><code>PyConBalkan</code></a> label on
GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/212">#212</a> - moderate - Convert jQ to $ -
  this is an easy search &amp; rename but will require more extensive manual testing</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/431">#431</a> - moderate to hard - Remove JavaScript fireEvent() -
  17 matches in <code>static/js/</code>. Must be replaced with direct function calls</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/652">#652</a> - easy - Removal of labels from form fields -
  all labels must be included in the HTML template and marked for translation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/681">#681</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/682">#682</a> - moderate -
  Move API modules &amp; their tests from <code>xmlrpc/api/&lt;app&gt;.py</code> to <code>&lt;app&gt;/api.py</code>. These have good test
  coverage so you have to make sure you don't break anything</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/971">#971</a> - moderate - manage.py command for changing Site URL -
  will help with automatic provisioning, e.g. Ansible. For howto see
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/custom-management-commands/">Django docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1021">#1021</a> - moderate - Update TestCase page UI to allow adding TestPlans to cases -
  use <code>TestPlan.add_case()</code> API method and refresh the widget. See how Tags and Components cards work
  in the same page</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1070">#1070</a> - moderate - manage.py command for checking email settings -
  will help with troubleshooting misconfigured email. Must raise exceptions if something fails.
  For howto see
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/custom-management-commands/">Django docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/733">#733</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/736">#736</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/738">#738</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/883">#883</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/1089">#1089</a> - hard to very hard - New checkers for pylint -
  Kiwi TCMS uses customized pylint checkers to discover various conditions. We need a few more
  of them and/or update of the existing ones</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to see you in Belgrade. Until then: Happy testing!</p>

    <strong>Aneta Petkova</strong> - QA Chapter Lead at SumUp
    <em></em>

    <p>
        Aneta is a software engineer navigating the complex field of QA
        since her first "grownup" job. She's been working in the area of
        test automation for web applications using different programming languages and tools.

        Her mission is to inspire people to think about quality from the
        very inception of ideas and to blur the line between developers and
        QA specialists.

<h2>What is your professional background</h2>
<p>I have an engineering degree in computer science and I've spend the last 8 years in Quality Assurance.
Java, TestNG and UI automation with Selenium WebDriver are my strongest technical skills but
I use different programming languages and tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe languages and tools should only support an engineer and never define them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently I am the QA Chapter Lead at <a href="https://sumup.com/">SumUp</a>,
where I can work towards achieving my goals in an amazing team of people that do what they love.</p>
<h2>When did you use open source for the first time</h2>
<p>The first time I remember was in 2011, but I've probably used it before and just didn't pay attention.
To me it seemed the same as proprietary, and I guess that means it was good.</p>
<h2>Describe your contributions to the project</h2>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/junit-plugin/">kiwitcms-junit-plugin</a>.
This is a native Java library which you can install via Maven Central. It
will discover your automated test suite and publish test execution results in
Kiwi TCMS. This plugin is very simple and requires only minimal configuration
before it is ready to work.
Check-out the example in <a href="https://tcms.kiwitcms.org/plan/25/">TP-25</a>!</p>
<p><em>editor comment:</em> Aneta and Ivo (Kiwi TCMS) hosted the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5sp0e7LsDc">"Git crash course" workshop at HackConf 2018</a>.
Kiwi TCMS will be hosting 2 workshops this year so stay tuned!</p>
<h2>Why did you decide to contribute to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>I had recently switched Java for Ruby and I was feeling nostalgic.
Also, I had spent my entire career so far in QA and I wanted to slip on
the developer shoes for at least a little bit.</p>
<h2>Was there something which was hard for you during the contribution process</h2>
<p>I'm used to working in a team and when I started working on this project
I was the only active Java developer. Luckily for me, I live in the time of StackOverflow,
so I managed to get most of my questions answered by strangers on the Internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned tons of stuff, but mostly I learned I can build software, not just test it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Which is the best part of contributing to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Doing something that has the potential to help others and that could be improved upon.</p>
<h2>What is next for you in professional and open source plan</h2>
<p>My current focus is moving slightly into DevOps direction and I am really overwhelmed
by the amount of things to learn. I feel there is so much I want to experiment with.
I am not really planning anything related to open source - it has never been a goal for me -
but when I come across a project I feel strongly about, I'd probably be tempted to contribute.</p>

    <strong>Primož Klemen</strong> -
    <em>QA tester, full time dad, Manchester United F.C. supporter</em>

    <p>
        Primož is an early adopter and our Slovenian translator. He's been actively engaging
        in GitHub issues, posted pull requests for improving documentation and follows us on
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kiwi-tcms">StackOverflow</a> as well.

<h2>What is your professional background</h2>
<p>I've started working in IT as tech support for the 2nd largest Slovenian ISP at the time.
Then I've been at leading software provider for fintech in the Balkans region in the same
role and gradually transitioned into QA role. Currently, I'm working as a QA tester for
<a href="http://better.care">Better (by Marand)</a> and ensure, with help of my colleagues of course,
proper quality of administration application for health care sector.</p>
<h2>When did you use open source for the first time</h2>
<p>If I recall correctly that would be some 14 years ago when I ditched dreaded
Internet Explorer in favor of Mozilla Firefox browser. The whole Internet got better in
a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2>What are your contributions to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>I mainly contribute via translating the application into my native language, Slovenian.
Currently there are
<a href="https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms">7 languages available</a> for Kiwi TCMS so you are
more than welcome to join and add another one.
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html#translation">Translating via Crowdin</a>
is very simple and requires no additional technical skills. I've also dabbled into project
documentation and proposed a few updates to it. I'm also the culprit for some
<a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/Prome88">32 issues</a> and counting,
the majority of them being proposals for future application enhancements and few UX/UI bugs
(déformation professionnelle :-)).</p>
<h2>Why did you decide to contribute to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The guys and gals from the Kiwi TCMS team provided us with an application which solved
our pain about building, maintaining and running manual regression tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They did all of that for free in their spare time! So I've decided to give something back to
the whole community. This was indeed my first
contribution to the open source world but not the last. Since then I've also
contributed to other projects which I use on a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In hindsight, Kiwi TCMS converted me from an open source user to open source contributor!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Was there something which was hard for you during the contribution process</h2>
<p>Contributing to the project, as a non-developer, is very easy and intuitive by
either opening issues on GitHub or translating via Crowdin or even committing
updated documentation to git repository through GitHub Desktop client.
All of the aforementioned was new to me and I've learned in depth how to use
these tools. I've also had the pleasure to familiarize myself with project documentation
- Sphinx and reStructuredText are my two new best friends.</p>
<h2>Which is the best part of contributing to Kiwi TCMS</h2>
<p>Being able to actively improve an application that we use on a daily basis in our
development process. Getting to know more people from all around the globe and see their
insights about software quality assurance thus learning something new every day.</p>
<h2>What is next for you in professional and open source plan</h2>
<p>Professionally I'm 100% committed to <a href="http://better.care">Better (by Marand)</a> and helping us achieve
the best standard of quality for health care applications which also incorporates
using the knowledge gathered by following and/or contributing to open source.
I'm going to continue contributing to Kiwi TCMS and
Captura and if time allows maybe involve myself with some other interesting projects.</p>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2019/01/10/project-mission-and-goals-for-2019/">2019 mission and roadmap</a>.
TL,DR: Kiwi TCMS has made progress since January, it's been tough and may not have been
very visible. I feel like we've been behind schedule till now! The greatest
positive thing has been community and team development!</p>
<h2>Complete the internal refactoring</h2>
<p><em>Status: minimal progress, needs help</em></p>
<p><a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> progress is:</p>
<ul>
<li>-30 code smells</li>
<li>-40 duplications</li>
<li>-30 other issues</li>
<li>4% technical debt improvement</li>
<li>-200 hrs remaining until issues are fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>This is mostly the result of code reviews and minor fixes, not targeted work.</p>
<p>We have not done any targeted work to resolve other issues reported by Scrutinizer,
Pylint, remove vendored-in JavaScript libraries, JavaScript refactoring or
classification of issues in 3rd party dependencies.</p>
<p>There are new people onboarding in the team right now and our plan is for
them to start grinding at these issues very soon!</p>
<h2>Redesign the UI templates with the help of Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: 50% done, needs help</em></p>
<p>There are 27 HTML templates remaining to be redesigned (from 59). That's mostly
due to internal cleanup than targeted refactoring. More work on this item
will probably follow towards the end of the year after we get more priority items out of
the way and get more of the new team members rolling!</p>
<h2>Modernize reporting aka Telemetry</h2>
<p><em>Status: in progress, a bit behind schedule</em></p>
<p>The specs for the new <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/">Telemetry</a> system
have been defined after taking into account feedback on GitHub issues. Anton Sankov is
the leading developer for this feature. So far we have 2 telemetry reports merged:
testing break-down and status matrix. The next one will be execution trends.</p>
<p>There are lots of minor issues or missing functionality in these first iterations
(compared to specification). Our plan is to have the major use-cases satisfied first
and then work to refine all of the existing telemetry pages.</p>
<h2>Plugins for 3rd party test automation frameworks</h2>
<p><em>Status: good, needs help</em></p>
<p>Until now we have released TAP, junit.xml and native JUnit 5 plugins. There's also
a PHPUnit plugin which is more or less complete but unreleased yet. Both JUnit 5
and PHPUnit plugins are developed by external contributors!</p>
<p>We often get asked for plugins for languages and frameworks we don't use or don't
even know! Given that our expertise is mostly in Python we will gladly accept your
pull requests if you decide to maintain or contribute to one of the plugins. This
will also help us get insight into what automation frameworks people are using
and how exactly you structure a test automation workflow around Kiwi TCMS.</p>
<p>Checkout the
<a href="https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html">documentation</a> for links
and more info.</p>
<h2>Redefine bug-tracker integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Last week, right after OpenExpo, we did a check-up session and this was one of the
areas identified with zero amount of progress. I have a strong preference to work
on this feature myself but have not been able to due to various other items that
need my attention.</p>
<p>The short version is that I'd prefer to remove all issue tracker specific code
and allow the tester to add arbitrary URLs to link to existing bugs. How to do
integration (even as simple as publishing a comment in the bug tracker) over
a generic interface still eludes me. In the next few weeks I will kick-off this
topic with a separate blog post/issue for everyone to comment on.</p>
<h2>GitHub flow integration</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Our team spent some time making Kiwi TCMS the first open source TCMS available
on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms">GitHub Marketplace</a>. We will
continue this integration effort and flow integration will emerge from that.
There's also many things that need to be done to satisfy GitHub's .</p>
<h2>Agile integration with Trello</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<h2>Improve engineering productivity</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Our mission is to transform testing in your organization by providing
the tools for that via Kiwi TCMS. It is astonishing that so far nobody has provided
any kind of feedback in <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/703">Issue #703</a>
wrt improving productivity in their teams!</p>
<p>We have some ideas which have been blocked by lack of resources on the team and
refactoring tasks. Because we've adopted this as our mission this is an important
item for us and we'll continue working on it as resources allow.
Progress is to be expected towards the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><em>Status: great, on track, needs work</em></p>
<p>This is our strongest area during the year so far. We have a strong presence in
several communities, our event schedule is busy enough and we are gaining more
recognition every day!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted project stand at 3/5 conferences with 2 more on-track</li>
<li>Won the OpenAward for <a href="2019-06-24-openawards-winner.markdown">Best Tech Community</a></li>
<li>Hosted several presentations and workshops with few more on track</li>
<li>Found new talent to join the core team: 2 just ready to start contributing, 5 more in training</li>
<li>1 more senior engineer as a mentor. We also have a few independent wanna-be contributors
  and will be hosting qualification interviews for marketing assistant very soon</li>
<li>There are contributions and pull requests coming from users of Kiwi TCMS as well.
  We'd like to see more of course.</li>
<li>There are a couple of open source projects and companies using Kiwi TCMS who
  are friendly towards the project. We are working with them to get a public
  endorsement on the website and engage in more technical work together. Of course
  everyone has limited resources and is very busy :-(</li>
<li>Sponsors on <a href="https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms#contributors">OpenCollect</a> are just
  a few but we didn't have any previously so this is a good sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the moment to mention that not all is honey and roses in open source land.
Kiwi TCMS suffers from the problem that many of our users can't be contributors
or simply don't want to!</p>
<p>Manual testers can't program. This is a fact and a good sized chunk of our user base
actually performs manual testing. Those that can write automation and probably
code decently well may not be familiar with Python and Django. At least in Bulgaria
these two aren't very popular, definitely not among testers. That is to say this part
of the user-base simply doesn't have the necessary skills to contribute and the majority
of what we need is code contribution!</p>
<p>Another (fairly big IMO) group of users are coming from proprietary companies who
view open source and Kiwi TCMS as a zero cost option. Something that they take free
of charge and use it without ever contributing back. They don't understand nor really
care about the open source culture.</p>
<p>To make things worse we receive requests every single day via
our private email addresses or questions via IM despite our website clearly stating
community engagement rules. On a few occasions we have received very rude comments
of the sort "our company demands you fix this", "is this going to be ready this year"
(context implying entitlement), etc. To make things more ridiculous we've even received
support requests (via contact form) from companies and start-up
who get their return address wrong so we can't get in touch directly!</p>
<p>In short: don't demand anything from us unless you are ready to pay for it, work for it
yourself or propose a mutually beneficial scenario. We do try to keep the community
happy but more importantly follow our mission and develop our core team!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

We need your help one more time. Our team has submitted participation in
'Best Tech Community' and 'Best Success Story' categories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our submission into 'Best Success Story' has been pulled down!
We used that category to share the story from a dead open source project into
a thriving open source community with lots of users and contributors and to
highlight some of our milestones. Here's the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of technical updates and refactoring, latest everything, modern UI</li>
<li>the <strong>only</strong> open source test case management system on GitHub Marketplace</li>
<li>nearly 60000 downloads on Docker Hub</li>

            <p>On Tuesday I hosted my pylint workshop during the regular
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/295673718035353/">Django Bulgaria meetup</a>.
This edition was the first which was practice based.</p>
<p>Attendance numbers were low but participation was very good. We managed to
create 4 new checkers for Kiwi TCMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/949">PR #949 - AutoField checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/950">PR #950 - OneToOneField checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/951">PR #951 - discover directories without __init__.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/952">PR #952 - empty class checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/955">PR #955 - function based view checker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to all contributors. These new checkers have discovered quite a
few new issues with Kiwi TCMS so this is an area which our team is going to improve.</p>
<p>Those who missed the workshop will be able to catch up one of the next editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>26-29 August, GUADEC, Thessaloniki - TBC (presentation)</li>
<li>end of September, Python meetup, Zagreb - TBA</li>
<li>03-05 October, PyCon Balkan, Belgrade - TBC</li>
<li>11-13 October, HackConf, Sofia</li>
<li>15-17 October, TestCon Europe, Vilnius - TBC (backup presentation)</li>
